# Skifity

**Self-hosted apps, powered by Kubernetes.**

You give it a server. It gives you URLs.

</div>

---

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.skifity.com | sudo sh
```

That is the whole installation. It checks the server, installs Kubernetes,
starts the panel, and prints a URL and a one-time token. Open the URL, create
your account, paste a Git repository, and you have an app on the internet with
HTTPS.

**That command does not work yet.** `get.skifity.com` does not resolve and
nothing has been released, so there is no one-line install to run — see
[Status](#status) for what does work today and what it is waiting on.

## What it is

Coolify and Dokploy run Docker, and their multi-server story is Docker Swarm,
which is in maintenance. Skifity runs Kubernetes, so several servers are one
pool: an app that wants three instances gets them wherever there is room, and an
app whose server dies is restarted elsewhere without anyone being woken up.

The panel itself costs **35 MiB of memory**. Coolify idles at 500 MB to 1.2 GB
and Dokploy at around 350 MB, because they run a web framework, a database, a
cache and a websocket server to be a panel. Skifity is one process.

What it does not do is make you learn Kubernetes. The panel talks about **Apps**,
**Instances**, **Servers**, **Domains** and **Databases**. The Kubernetes objects
are one click away under **Advanced**, and `kubectl` works normally — they are
simply not in the way.

## Adding a server is an IP address and a password

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/add-server.png" alt="The add server form: address, username, password" width="820">
</p>

Skifity connects, checks the machine, installs a key of its own, configures the
firewall, verifies the network in both directions, installs k3s and joins the
cluster — seven steps, each one shown as it happens.

Your password is used exactly once, to install that key, and is never stored. A
test asserts it: every column of the database is scanned for it.

## What is different about it

**Changing a setting does not rebuild your app.** The single most common
complaint about panels of this kind. Skifity separates what goes into the image
from what the container reads at start-up, so changing a variable is a rollout
in seconds. The panel tells you which kind you are setting before you save, and
says afterwards whether it rebuilt.

**Rolling back restores the settings too**, not just the image. If a variable
broke the app, rolling back puts the old variable back.

**It checks before you scale.** Before running a second instance, Skifity looks
for what would break — SQLite on a local disk, sessions in memory, a cron job
that assumes it is alone — and says what would go wrong and how to fix it.

**Errors are written to be acted on.** Every failure, in the panel, the CLI, the
API and the MCP server, says what happened, what it means and how to fix it,
with a button that copies the whole thing for an AI assistant.

**It never phones home.** No licence key, no telemetry, no update check, no call
to anything of ours — there is nothing of ours to call. It does reach the
internet for things you asked for: Let's Encrypt for a certificate, GitHub for
the component you just turned on, your Git provider, your S3 bucket. The one
exception worth knowing is that the preflight asks a public-IP service what the
server's address is, because a server behind NAT cannot tell you itself.

## Built for the terminal and for assistants

One binary is the panel, the CLI and an MCP server.

```sh
skifity deploy                    # deploy this directory
skifity logs --follow             # watch it
skifity env set LOG_LEVEL=debug   # change something, without a rebuild
skifity rollback                  # undo it
```

```sh
claude mcp add skifity -- skifity mcp
```

[`llms.txt`](llms.txt) describes the whole product on one page, and the panel
serves it at `/llms.txt`. See [the CLI guide](docs/cli.md).

## Five languages, properly

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/overview-russian.png" alt="The same overview in Russian" width="820">
</p>

English, Indonesian, Hindi, Russian and Simplified Chinese, all complete. A
build fails if any string is missing from any language, if a plural form a
language needs is absent — Russian needs one, few and many — or if a translation
drops a placeholder. Dates, numbers and relative times are formatted by the
language, not translated around.

## Sign in with the account people already have

OpenID Connect, against Okta, Entra ID, Authentik, Keycloak, Zitadel or Google:
PKCE, a verified ID token, a nonce per sign-in and a single-use state. Restrict
it to your own email domains, and decide whether a first sign-in creates an
account or is refused until somebody invites them.

An account made this way has no password, cannot be signed into with one, and is
refused in a way that does not tell an anonymous visitor which addresses use
single sign-on.

## What you need

A server with Ubuntu 24.04 or Debian 12, 1 GB of memory, 8 GB of free disk, and
root over SSH. Any VPS will do. 2 GB is comfortable.

A fresh install is deliberately small: Kubernetes and the panel, and nothing
else. The panel is **35 MiB of resident memory idle**, measured, and does not
drift. Certificates, the builder, the PostgreSQL operator and the rest install
themselves the first time you use them, and each one says what it costs first.

## 282 one-click applications

WordPress, Ghost, Gitea, GitLab, n8n, Vaultwarden, Metabase, BookStack, MinIO,
Chatwoot, Uptime Kuma and about two hundred and seventy more, grouped by what
they are for. Thirty-eight of them install more than one app — a web app and its
worker, a service and its search index — which land in the same environment and
reach each other by name.

Every one of them **names a version**, and every version was fetched from its
registry to prove it exists. That sounds like a detail until you roll back: an
image on `latest` is not a version, so restoring it restores a tag rather than
the thing that worked. More than half of the largest competing catalogue ships
`latest`.

A template is a file in [`internal/templates/catalogue`](internal/templates/catalogue),
not Go, so adding one is a pull request anybody can write and `make check` tells
you whether it is right.

## Documentation

Also served by the panel itself, at `/docs`, from inside the binary — which is
where you want it when the cluster is broken and the server has no browser and
no way out to the internet.

| [Adding servers](docs/adding-servers.md) | The seven steps, and what to do when one fails |
| [Templates](docs/templates.md) | What a one-click install does, and what it does not |

| [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) | The rules that are load-bearing |

## Building it yourself

```sh
make build     # the frontend, then one binary with it inside
make check     # every linter, then the tests
make smoke     # end to end against a real panel
```

Go 1.26 and Node 22. `CGO_ENABLED=0` everywhere, so a release binary is static
and runs on anything.

## Status

Honest version, two parts.

**Nothing is published.** `get.skifity.com` does not resolve. There is no
`skifity/skifity` repository on GitHub — this one lives at
`TegarTheGreat/Skifity`. No image has been pushed to `ghcr.io/skifity/skifity`,
and no release has been tagged, so the CLI download in the installer has nothing
to download. Every one-line install command in this README and in the
documentation is what the install will be, not what it is. `plugins.skifity.com`
does not resolve either, so the panel's plugin store reads an index that is not
there yet; a plugin is installed by giving its address. What works today:
clone the repository, `make image`, and run `installer/install.sh` from inside
the clone with `SKIFITY_IMAGE` pointed at the image you just built — the
installer then reads its manifests from disk. [Quick
start](docs/quick-start.md) has the exact commands.

**Nothing has run against a real cluster.** The environment this was built in
refuses privileged containers, so k3s could never be started in it. Everything
that needs a cluster is tested against a fake API server, golden manifests, a
real in-process SSH server and shell syntax checks — which exercises the same
code path and is not the same thing as having run.
[`docs/progress.md`](docs/progress.md) says exactly what has and has not been
executed.

Treat it as something to try on a spare VPS, not something to move production
onto this afternoon.
