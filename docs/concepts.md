# Concepts

Skifity deliberately uses ordinary words. This page says what each one means,
and what it is underneath, so that nothing is a mystery when you need to look.

## The words

| Skifity says | It means | Underneath |
|---|---|---|
| **Team** | Who can see and change things | A row, not a Kubernetes object |
| **Project** | Things that belong together | A group of namespaces |
| **Environment** | Production, staging, a preview | A Namespace |
| **App** | One thing you deployed | A Deployment, a Service and an Ingress |
| **Instance** | One running copy of an app | A Pod |
| **Server** | A machine you own | A Node |
| **Domain** | An address that reaches an app | An Ingress rule and a Certificate |
| **Database** | A managed PostgreSQL, Redis or MySQL | A Cluster or a StatefulSet |
| **Variable** | Something your app reads from the environment | A key in a Secret |
| **Volume** | Storage that survives a restart | A PersistentVolumeClaim |
| **Deployment** *(the noun in the history)* | One attempt to run a new version | A build, then a rollout |

Every app's **Advanced** tab shows the exact objects the panel applies. Nothing
is hidden; it is only kept out of the way.

## Projects and environments

A project is a box. Inside it are environments, and inside those are apps and
databases.

Every project gets a **Production** environment when it is created. Add more for
staging, or let Skifity create one per pull request.

Environments are isolated from each other: each is a namespace with
default-deny networking, so an app in staging cannot reach production's database
by accident.

## Variables, and why some rebuild and some do not

An app's variables become environment variables inside it. There are two kinds,
and the difference matters:

* A **runtime variable** is read by your app when it starts. Changing one
  restarts the app with the new value. That takes seconds, and no rebuild.
* A **build-time variable** is baked into the image, which front-end builds do
  with things like a public API URL. Changing one means the image is wrong, so
  the app is rebuilt.

Skifity works this out from a fingerprint of everything that actually affects
the image. The panel tells you which kind you are setting before you save it,
and says afterwards whether it rebuilt.

This is the thing most often complained about in other panels, where changing
any setting triggers a ten-minute rebuild. Here it does not.

## Deployments and rollback

Each deployment records the image it produced *and* the settings it ran with:
variables, instance count, resources, domains.

Rolling back therefore restores a working state, not just an old image. If you
changed a variable and the app broke, rolling back puts the old variable back
too.

## Instances and scaling

An app runs one instance by default. You can set a fixed number, or let Skifity
add and remove instances based on CPU or memory.

Before you scale, the panel checks whether the app *can* run more than once. It
looks for the things that break: a SQLite file on a local disk, sessions kept in
memory, a background job that assumes it is the only one. Each finding says what
would go wrong and how to fix it.

Instances are spread across servers where possible, so losing a server does not
take an app down.

## Servers

The first server runs the control plane: the Kubernetes API, the panel and its
database. Others join it.

With one control plane server, a reboot means a few minutes of downtime for the
cluster's control — your apps keep running. With three, losing one changes
nothing. Any server can be promoted.

## Secrets

Every secret Skifity stores — database passwords, Git tokens, your apps'
variables — is encrypted with a key of its own, and that key is wrapped with a
master key kept outside the database.

A leaked database backup is therefore useless on its own. The flip side is that
losing the master key loses every secret, which is why the panel makes you
download a recovery key before it stops nagging.

Once stored, a secret's value is never shown again, by the panel, the CLI, the
API or an AI assistant.

## Components

A fresh install is small: k3s, the panel, and nothing else. Heavier pieces are
installed the first time you need them.

| Component | Installed when | Roughly |
|---|---|---|
| cert-manager | You add a domain | 120 MB |
| Image registry | You first deploy from source | 60 MB |
| Builder | You first deploy from source | 200 MB |
| PostgreSQL operator | You create a PostgreSQL database | 150 MB |
| Scale to zero | You turn it on | 180 MB |
| Cross-node storage | You turn it on | 700 MB per server |
| Full monitoring | You turn it on | 900 MB |

Settings shows what is installed and what each one costs before you agree to it.
