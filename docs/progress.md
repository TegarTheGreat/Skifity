# Progress

Read this file, `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/decisions.md` first if you are picking this
project up cold.

## Sandbox constraints (important)

The environment this was built in has Docker but **refuses privileged containers
and host-network relays**, so k3d/kind clusters and VMs could never be started.
See ADR-0010. Nothing below is called verified unless it was actually executed.
Where a cluster is required, the code is written and unit-tested against a fake
clientset and golden manifests, and that is said plainly rather than glossed over.

## What is done

### Phase 0 — done

* `docs/research/competitors.md` — 13 products compared, weaknesses we design against.
* `docs/research/stack.md` — component versions verified 2026-09-16, reconciled
  with the code 2026-09-17.
* `docs/architecture.md` — layers, deploy path, add-server state machine, data model, isolation.
* `docs/decisions.md` — ADR-0001 onwards; there are nineteen.

### Phase 1 — done

* Go module, package layout, `Makefile` with build/dev/test/lint/smoke/release.
* `golangci-lint` configured and clean; `go vet` and `gofmt` clean.
* ESLint and Prettier configured; `npm run lint` clean with zero warnings.
* Frontend: Vite 6, React 19, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui only, app shell with
  sidebar, header, command palette, dark/light theme applied before first paint.
* Five languages complete (446 keys each), with a checker that fails the build on
  a missing key, an extra key, an empty string, a dropped placeholder, or a
  plural form the language does not have. Deliberately broken translations were
  used to confirm it actually fails.
* The built frontend is embedded in the binary; a deep link reloads correctly and
  fingerprinted assets are cached for a year while `index.html` is not.
* GitHub Actions CI: Go vet, format check, golangci-lint, tests, race tests;
  frontend i18n check, lint, type-check and build; then the smoke test.

**Verified by running it:** `make build` produces one 55 MB binary that serves
the localized UI and the health API; `/apps/app_x` falls back to `index.html`;
`test/smoke/panel.sh` passes all 26 checks against that binary.

### Phase 2 — done, not run on a real server

* `installer/install.sh` — POSIX shell, no bashisms, checks the server before it
  changes anything, installs k3s with embedded etcd and WireGuard between nodes,
  prepares the panel's directories, generates the setup token, works out a
  hostname, applies the panel and prints a URL and a token. Safe to run again:
  every step checks what is already there.
* `installer/uninstall.sh` — removes the panel by default, k3s with `--all`, and
  the data only with `--purge` and a typed confirmation. `--dry-run` prints what
  it would do and changes nothing.
* `deploy/` — the panel's own objects, also usable with `kubectl apply -f`.
* `Dockerfile` — three stages down to a distroless image holding one static
  binary, running as a non-root user.

**Verified:** `test/smoke/installer.sh` runs 26 checks — both scripts parse under
`sh` and `dash`, failures carry a cause and a fix, every manifest renders with
nothing left to substitute, the plain-HTTP route does not claim a certificate it
does not have, and nothing is installed on the machine running the test. A Go
test parses the rendered Deployment and asserts it runs as non-root with a
read-only root filesystem, no capabilities, no CPU limit, the Recreate strategy
and the node pinning. Both were confirmed to fail when the manifests were
deliberately broken.

**Not verified:** the installer has never been run on a real server. It needs
root, systemd and a kernel k3s can use, none of which this sandbox allows.

### Phase 3 — code complete, tested

Accounts, Argon2id passwords, sessions, TOTP implemented in-house, API tokens,
CSRF double-submit, security headers, an audit log, and envelope encryption with
per-secret DEKs, context binding, master-key rotation and a printable recovery
key. Unit tests cover the envelope format against bit-flips and non-canonical
encodings, and rotation across every encrypted column.

### Phases 4–7 — code complete, cluster not exercised

Adding a server over SSH (seven idempotent steps), preflight checks, firewall
rules written per source address, k3s install and join, promotion and removal
with drain; manifest generation with probes, limits, spread and network policies;
builds through Railpack and BuildKit; deployments, rollback, autoscaling and the
scaling readiness checker; managed PostgreSQL, Redis and MariaDB; backups to S3
through presigned URLs so storage credentials never enter a tenant namespace.

Exercised against a fake clientset, golden manifests, a real in-process SSH
server that records the commands it receives, and `sh -n` on every generated
script. Not exercised against a real cluster.

### Phases 8–9 — done

The CLI and the MCP server are built on the same API as the panel, and both
render errors with their cause, impact and fix. The panel has the project canvas,
one-step templates, the error catalogue, and the build fingerprint that keeps a
configuration change from rebuilding an image.

Added since:

* `llms.txt`, describing the whole product on one page, served by the panel at
  `/llms.txt`.
* `SKIFITY_URL` and `SKIFITY_TOKEN`, so the CLI and the MCP server work with no
  interactive sign-in and no stored configuration — which is how CI, a
  container and an assistant's sandbox actually use them. The team is worked
  out from the token's account when there is only one.
* `skifity admin reset-password` and `skifity admin list-users`, which read the
  panel's database directly on the server. Nobody being able to sign in is the
  one thing the API cannot fix, and a self-hosted panel has no mail server it
  can trust to send a reset link.
* Connecting a Git account and choosing where to be notified, both of which had
  a complete API and no way to reach it from the panel. Connecting a Git account
  shows the webhook address once, with a copy button, because a self-hosted
  Gitea whose token cannot register a webhook needs it pasted in by hand.
* `docs/configuration.md` and `docs/backups.md`.
* The documentation is served by the panel itself, from inside the binary, so
  the roughly twenty links in the error catalogue resolve on a server with no
  outbound network — which is when they matter. A test walks every `WithDocs`
  link and every link between pages, and fails on a missing page or a missing
  anchor. Both failure modes were confirmed by breaking a link on purpose.

### Phase 10 — done, except a run on real hardware

* `govulncheck` and `npm audit` are clean and run in CI. The one advisory left
  is `golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp` being unmaintained, in a package this code
  never imports; govulncheck reports zero reachable vulnerabilities.
* A Playwright interface test covering first-run setup, the recovery-key gate,
  the shell, the theme, and all five languages. It runs against the real binary
  serving the embedded frontend, so what is tested is what ships.
* GoReleaser: static binaries for Linux and macOS on both architectures, and a
  multi-architecture distroless image, on a tag.
* The documentation set: quick start, concepts, adding servers, the CLI and AI
  assistants, troubleshooting, questions — plus a README with real screenshots
  taken by the test suite, so an image can never show a screen that no longer
  exists.
* Apache 2.0.

**The interface test found a real bug the completeness checker could not:**
Simplified Chinese resolved to English at runtime. `nonExplicitSupportedLngs`
makes i18next check the *language part* of a code against `supportedLngs`, so
asking for `zh-CN` looked up `zh`, did not find it, and fell back. The locale
file was complete the whole time. Fixed by registering the bundle under `zh` as
well, which also gets `zh-TW` and `zh-HK` a Simplified page rather than an
English one.

### After an adversarial audit

The whole product was read back against what it claims, one dimension at a time,
looking for the class of defect a sandbox with no cluster cannot catch: code that
compiles, tests that pass, and a feature that was never once executed. What came
out of it:

* **Notifications were configured and never sent.** `notify.Send` was called from
  exactly one place in the codebase — the "send a test message" button. No
  deployment failure, backup failure, lost server or certificate failure ever
  produced one, although the panel let an operator subscribe to all of them.
  There is a dispatcher now, and the producers call it.
* **Nothing watched the cluster between user actions.** A node that stopped
  answering at three in the morning, an app whose last instance crashed, a
  certificate cert-manager had given up on: all three were visible only to
  somebody already looking at the right page. `internal/watch` compares the
  cluster with the database once a minute. It also fills in two columns the
  panel had written a query for and never called: a server's last seen time, and
  a domain's certificate status, which said "waiting for DNS" forever.
* **No app ever got a URL.** `kube.AutoHostname` was written, tested and called
  by nothing, so the free address the product promises on every page existed
  only as a function. A deploy now gives an app its automatic domain.
* **An app created from the panel had no port**, because the form does not ask,
  and a port of zero renders no Service, no Ingress and no URL.
* **A build could send a team's Git token to any host**, because the clone
  rewrote the URL to include the token whatever host was typed into the form.
* **An API token's team and scopes were stored and never read**, so a token
  issued for one team worked on every team, and a read-only token could do
  anything its owner could.
* **Two-factor recovery codes were generated, returned by the API, and dropped**
  by both sides; the account page never even rendered them.
* **Deleting a volume** authorized the app in the URL and then deleted whatever
  volume id came after it.
* **A backup job could not have run**: rejected by Pod Security for naming no
  seccomp profile and no user, then killed by its own package-install line, then
  refused by S3 for uploading from a pipe with no Content-Length.
* **The builder could never start**: rootless BuildKit needs a seccomp profile
  the panel's namespace refuses, and its readiness probe looked for a socket
  that is not there. Builds moved to their own namespace (ADR-0016).
* **Built images could never be pulled**, because they are tagged with a Service
  name the host's containerd cannot resolve (ADR-0017).
* **Every build was a cold build**: the cache was exported inline and imported
  from a tag nothing ever wrote.
* **Adding a server built a second cluster.** The panel decided a server was
  the first one by looking for a control-plane row in its own database, and a
  panel installed by `install.sh` has none. The first server anyone added was
  given `--cluster-init`, and its token could never have matched the real one
  anyway.
* **A second control-plane node joined with a different network backend** than
  the first, so the two never exchanged a packet.
* **A fork's pull request was handed the project's secrets**, because a preview
  environment copied every variable into a container built from the pull
  request's own code.
* **Scale to zero installed KEDA and changed nothing**: the flag was carried
  into the app spec and read by no manifest.
* **The MCP server's every tool answered "this token is not tied to a team"**
  for a token set up the documented way, and it had no way to create anything.
* **The logs tab could not show why a crash-looping app crashed**, because the
  container that printed it had already been replaced.
* **A superseded deployment kept building** and could roll out an older version
  after the newer one.
* **The event hub never forgot a topic**, so a panel up for a month held the
  build output of every deploy since it started.
* **Half the audit log was invisible**: every panel-wide event — password
  changes, settings, key rotation — was recorded with no team and the list
  filtered on the team alone.
* **Preview environments were never reclaimed** except by a webhook that had to
  arrive.
* **An instance's CPU and memory were always an em-dash**, and the panel's own
  database had no way to be copied that did not silently lose data.

### What was missing rather than broken

Three things the audit named repeatedly as gaps rather than defects, now built:

* **A release command and a one-off command.** There was no way to run anything
  in an app's environment, so a migration had nowhere to go. An app's release
  command runs on every deployment between the build and the rollout; a one-off
  command runs once on request. Both run in the app's own image with its own
  variables, as a Job rather than an exec, because the moment you need this
  most is when the app will not start.
* **Scheduled commands.** Cron existed and ran the panel's own backups; an app
  could not have one. Kubernetes does the scheduling now, so a panel restarting
  at three in the morning is not a reason for a job to be skipped.
* **Honest components.** "Full monitoring" had an Install button that always
  failed. It says how to install it instead.

### A second pass over the cluster, the backend and the frontend

The first audit asked "what does this claim that it never does". This one asked
a narrower question of the same three layers: what do the pieces do to each
other. Everything below was found by reading the rendered objects and the
selectors against one another, and each fix carries a test that was confirmed to
fail against the old behaviour.

* **Every followed log ended after thirty seconds.** `rest.Config`'s Timeout is
  the HTTP client's, so it bounds the response body as well as the request. A
  log stream is a request that succeeds at once and is then read for as long as
  somebody watches it, so one deadline for both kinds of call cut it off. The
  browser reconnected and replayed its tail, so live logs repeated themselves
  every half minute and a build log stopped part way through a build that was
  still running. There are two clients from one connection now.
* **A quiet log stream was dropped by whatever sat in front of it**, because it
  had no heartbeat and could not have written one while the handler was waiting
  on the pod.
* **An autoscaling app that could also sleep had two controllers.** It got an
  HorizontalPodAutoscaler and an HTTPScaledObject, and KEDA creates an
  HorizontalPodAutoscaler of its own for the second. Two of them pointed at one
  Deployment do not divide the work: each overwrites the other's replica count
  on every reconcile. KEDA owns the scaling when scale to zero is on, and the
  scaling tab says so rather than leaving two fields on screen that no longer
  decide anything.
* **The disruption budget deadlocked a node drain.** `minAvailable: 1` permits
  two of three instances to go at once and none at all when an autoscaled app is
  sitting at its minimum of one — so `kubectl drain` waited forever for an
  eviction that could never be allowed. `maxUnavailable: 1` is the promise that
  was meant: one at a time, at every instance count.
* **A migration's pod counted as an instance of the app.** It carried the app's
  own selector labels, so it appeared on the instances tab as though it were
  serving traffic, its CPU was averaged into the autoscaler's decision, and it
  could be picked as the pod to read the app's logs from — which is how somebody
  opens the logs tab during a nightly job and reads the job instead.
* **A deleted app kept running.** Deleting it removed the Deployment, the
  Service, the Ingress and the Secret, and left the scheduled commands: the
  nightly job went on firing every night forever against an image nothing would
  pull. The wake Service and the HTTPScaledObject were left too.
* **A scheduled command's history was empty by morning**, because it inherited
  the one-off's hour-long TTL, and the morning is exactly when somebody looks for
  the run that failed.
* **The nixpacks builder could never have built anything.** Its buildctl line
  read `.nixpacks/Dockerfile` and no step ever wrote one. It is reachable from
  the API and the CLI; the panel's own form only offers auto and Dockerfile,
  which is why nobody had hit it.
* **An app and a database could take each other's address.** They are unique
  among themselves, share a namespace, and both render a Service under their
  slug — so a Redis called "web" next to an app called "web" took the app's
  Service over while its Ingress went on pointing at the name. Both creation
  paths now refuse the collision and say what holds it.
* **A render that threw blanked the whole panel.** React unmounts the tree when
  nothing catches it, and what is left is a white page and a console message. On
  a self-hosted panel that is the worst failure there is: the cluster is fine,
  the apps are serving, and the operator cannot tell. There are two error
  boundaries now, and the one inside the shell leaves the navigation working so
  the person can simply go somewhere else.

**What this pass did not find:** the store, the authorization layer and the
event hub came out clean. Every team-scoped handler goes through `authorizeTeam`
or `authorizeApp`, every write is serialised behind one mutex and every raw
statement runs inside `db.Tx`, and the SSE handler already had its heartbeat,
its replay and `X-Accel-Buffering`.

### The roadmap, worked through

`docs/roadmap.md` set out what was left, largest first: the things that decide
whether a panel survives its second month, then the questions people actually
ask it, then two features that were gaps rather than defects. All of it is
built.

* **The registry collects its garbage.** Every build pushed an image and nothing
  ever removed one — the first open issue on this page since the day it was
  written, and the one that ends with a full disk and every pod on the node
  stopping at once. The panel untags what nothing can reach and a Job runs the
  registry's own collector beside the files. Builds are held while it runs,
  because a push concurrent with a collection is the one case the registry's
  documentation says corrupts an image, and the panel is the only thing that
  starts builds.
* **The panel's own database stops growing.** Deployment records, audit entries
  and finished operations were written and never removed. A daily pass, with the
  window in settings; the activity log keeps a year by default, because a log
  that forgets is most of the way to not having one.
* **A pending instance says why.** It used to say "waiting for a server with
  enough free CPU and memory" whatever the reason, which is right about a third
  of the time and otherwise sends somebody to add a server for a quota, a
  volume, or a control-plane node that does not take apps. Kubernetes writes the
  answer onto the pod; the panel now reads it. A quota refusal never reaches a
  pod at all, so that one is read off the Deployment.
* **An environment's limits are visible before they are hit**, once something is
  above sixty per cent.
* **The panel can be monitored.** `GET /api/metrics`, in the Prometheus format,
  behind the same authentication as everything else, written by hand rather than
  pulled in.
* **A repository is read before it is built.** `builder.Detect` had been written,
  tested and called by nothing. The panel reads the tree through the provider's
  API — two requests, no clone — and says what it found while the form is still
  open, as a guess presented as a guess.
* **A volume can be backed up**, mounted read-only, as the app's own user, on
  the node that holds it.
* **The frontend is split by what changes**, and the labels only a screen reader
  hears are translated — "Close", "Loading", "Toggle Sidebar" were all hardcoded
  English in a panel shipping five languages, and the i18n check now fails the
  build on the next one.

### A second pass over tenant isolation

The roadmap put this next because it is the one class of bug where being wrong
is not recoverable. Every route was traced to its authorization helper, every
second id in a URL checked against the first, and the CLI, the MCP server and
the Git webhook followed back to the same checks — the first two go through the
HTTP API with the caller's own token, so there is no second surface to get
wrong, and the webhook skips any app whose team is not the connection's.

Three things came out of it.

* **The panel could be pointed at the cloud metadata service.** A Git
  connection's base URL and a notification channel's webhook are both settings
  holding an address the panel's own process requests. The webhook path echoed
  part of the response back in its error, which turns a test message into a
  read. `internal/netguard` refuses link-local, loopback, the unspecified
  address and multicast at connection time, on the resolved address rather than
  the hostname. Private ranges stay allowed: a self-hosted Gitea on 10.0.0.5 is
  the ordinary case here, not the attack.
* **Unlinking a database authorized the database and not the app.** Linking
  checks both and says so in a comment; unlinking checked one. It removed no
  variable it did not own, and did re-apply that app's configuration to the
  cluster.
* **The api package had no tests.** "Authorization lives in one place" was true
  and unenforced. Six now run against the real router with a real database and
  keyring: every shape of id one team can ask another for, the token's team
  binding, read-only scopes, what is open without credentials, what is
  administrator-only.

What did not turn anything up: the authorize helpers themselves, the SSE topic
authorization, the encryption contexts, secret disclosure through the variables
and credentials endpoints, and the webhook's team scoping.

### A pass over the code that runs as root on somebody's server

The provisioning path had never been read this session and is where a defect
does the most damage: it runs shell as root on a machine the user owns, and it
can delete the cluster. Two things came out of it, and the second explains why
the first had survived.

* **`%q` is not shell quoting, and every generated script used it.** Go's `%q`
  produces a Go double-quoted literal; a shell reading a double-quoted string
  still expands `$` and a backtick, and `%q` escapes neither. So
  `fmt.Sprintf("TARGET=%q", "1.2.3.4$(id)")` produces `TARGET="1.2.3.4$(id)"`
  and the shell runs `id`. The code reads as though it is defended and is not.
  Every script this panel generates used it — the ones that provision a server
  over SSH and the ones that build an image. `internal/shellsafe` quotes with
  single quotes, the only quoting a POSIX shell does not look inside, and a test
  puts both forms through a real `sh` and shows the difference rather than
  asserting it. The one reachable path was the SSH account name, which was never
  validated; it is now checked against the shape a distribution produces.
* **The guard against destroying the cluster counted the wrong thing.** Removing
  a control plane node is refused when too few would be left, and it counted
  rows in one team's table rather than the nodes that actually run the cluster.
  A panel installed by `install.sh` has no row for the node it runs on, and a
  panel with more than one team splits the rest between them, so the number was
  low by at least one and scoped to the wrong thing. It refused removals from a
  healthy four-node control plane, and at zero it permitted the one removal that
  deletes Kubernetes, every app, and the panel answering the request.

**And the pattern underneath both.** Three handlers checked "is this feature
configured" before the check that mattered — before validating the request,
before authorizing the second resource, before the quorum guard. Beyond the
small leak of telling somebody who may not touch an app whether databases are
configured, it means a safety check only runs on a configured panel, so nothing
can test it without a cluster. That is why this class kept surviving review. The
checks run first now, and the tests for them run against a panel with no cluster
at all.

## Phase 19 — the research, read back against the code

The three research pages were written before the code and never checked against
it afterwards. Reading them back found two promises the product did not keep and
a page that had drifted.

* **The WireGuard fallback did not exist.** The preflight told an operator that
  a kernel without the module was fine and that "traffic between your servers
  will use vxlan". Nothing did that: the backend was hardcoded to
  `wireguard-native` in the panel's install scripts and in `install.sh`, so the
  server joined a cluster it could not exchange a packet with, and neither k3s
  nor the panel reported anything wrong. The pod network is now one choice for
  the whole cluster, stored in `cluster.flannel_backend`. The installer picks it
  on the first node — where the fallback is real, because there is nothing yet
  to disagree with — and hands its choice to the panel, which records it and
  installs every later server the same way. A server whose kernel cannot run the
  cluster's backend is refused, with the two fixes that work.
* **Compose was announced, not implemented.** Detection reported "Docker
  Compose" and said services become separate apps and their links become
  variables. `ConvertCompose` was written, tested, and called by nothing; the
  Compose file's contents were never fetched; and `compose` was a source an app
  could be created with, which the API accepted, stored, and then deployed as a
  Git app with no repository. The reader is wired up now: the file is fetched
  and parsed, the services are listed with what did not carry over named against
  the service it came from, and picking one fills the form in — name, root
  directory, port, image or build, and the service's variables, which the create
  endpoint now seals before the first deploy. Skifity still runs one service per
  app, and the panel says so rather than implying an import.
* **A Dockerfile's `EXPOSE` line was never read.** Same cause: the file was
  found in the tree and then read back as an empty string, because it was not in
  the list of files fetched. The port detection it fed had never once produced
  an answer.
* **`docs/research/stack.md` had drifted** — `--write-kubeconfig-mode=0644`
  against 0600 in the code, a node label the code never sets, `--secrets-encryption`
  missing, self-hosted fonts the frontend deliberately does not use, and a link
  to a page that does not exist. It is reconciled, and a test now reads the
  flags out of the page and fails when no generated script passes one.

## Phase 20 — the tooling, and the catalogue

* **`make check` could not be run.** The README calls it "what CI runs" and it
  failed twice on tooling rather than code: golangci-lint refuses a module whose
  `go` directive is newer than the Go it was built with, and took the whole
  suite down with it, so nothing here had ever been linted; and
  `npm --prefix web exec -- tsc -b` keeps the directory it was called from, so
  tsc looked for a tsconfig.json at the repository root. `scripts/lint-go.sh`
  now builds the linter with this module's own toolchain, which cannot be out of
  step with it, and CI runs the same script with `LINT_STRICT=1` so it can never
  skip there. With the linter finally running it found eight things, all fixed,
  including two doc comments left behind by a rename.
* **The template catalogue had no tests, and a wrong template is silent.** A
  database whose `link_to` names no service was created and then never linked,
  so the app came up without the one variable it cannot run without and
  crash-looped with nothing on screen saying why. That now fails the install.
  The catalogue is checked for it, and for engines Skifity does not provision,
  variable names a container could not carry, services that ask for more memory
  than they are allowed, and templates nothing can open.
* **Four templates ran `latest`.** n8n, Vaultwarden, Umami and MinIO. A floating
  tag is not a version: two deploys of the same app run different software, a
  rollback restores a tag rather than the thing that worked, and an upstream
  release arrives on a restart nobody asked for — in a product whose whole point
  is that a rollback works. All four are pinned, the card shows the version, and
  a test refuses anything ending in `latest`.
* **`Icon` was a field the UI never read.** It is gone, and the card shows what
  the template installs instead.
* **Templates had no documentation page.** `docs/templates.md`, served by the
  panel like the rest.
* **The configuration file had three ways to be wrong quietly.** The struct's
  toml tag said `kubeconfig_path` and the parser looked for `kubeconfig`, so a
  file written from the struct was read, accepted and ignored. A `#` anywhere in
  a value cut the value short, whether or not it was inside quotes, so a path
  with a hash in it became a shorter path and what failed was whatever used it.
  A quote that was never closed was accepted, taking the comment somebody
  thought they were writing along with it. `internal/config` had no tests at
  all; it has them now, and one of them derives the list of settings from the
  struct and fails when any of them is missing from `docs/configuration.md` —
  which two of them already were.

### The claims, read back one by one

Every checkable claim in `README.md`, `llms.txt` and the documentation was put
against the code. Most held — the seven provisioning steps, the password that is
never stored and the test that scans every column for it, all fourteen MCP
tools, all thirty-two documented API routes, the three scaling risks named by
name, the copy-for-AI button, the placeholder check in the i18n script. These
did not:

* **"It does not contact any server but yours"**, and in the FAQ, "it does not
  contact any server at all". Skifity reaches Let's Encrypt, GitHub for the
  component manifests, the user's Git provider and S3 bucket — and the preflight
  asks a public-IP service for the address of a server being added, which is the
  one call a privacy-minded reader would actually want named. "It never phones
  home" is true and stays; the absolute around it is gone.
* **"Every command takes `--json`."** `open`, `logout`, `admin reset-password`
  and `admin backup-db` did not. That claim is aimed at assistants, who read it
  literally and get "flag provided but not defined". All four have it now, and a
  test reads the package and fails when a command is added without it.
* **The measured figures had drifted.** Idle memory is 35 MiB, not 34. The
  frontend is 314 KiB gzipped across nine files, not 278 across five — the chunk
  split in Phase 15 changed both numbers and neither was re-measured.
* **"Any server can be promoted."** True of the code, and that was the bug — see
  below.
* **Every published install path points at nothing.** See the open issues.

The API route table is now checked against the router itself: llms.txt is what
an assistant reads before calling anything, and a route that moved does not read
as a documentation mistake, it reads as the product being broken.

### Promotion wiped the node before checking it

The panel refuses to add a control plane server below 2 GB and 20 GB. It would
promote one without looking. Promotion drains the node, removes it from the
cluster and uninstalls Kubernetes before reinstalling it as a control plane
member, so the first thing to notice a machine too small for etcd was the
install at the very end — with the apps already moved off and a working worker
turned into a machine with nothing on it. The check runs first now, before
anything is touched.

### One panic used to end the panel

The HTTP handlers have recovered from a panic since the beginning. Nothing else
did. Every deployment, every server being added, every database, backup,
restore, health pass, scheduler tick and notification runs in a goroutine of its
own, and a panic in any of them took the process down — on a self-hosted install
that is the panel you would use to find out why, so the deployment that crashed
it also removed the way to diagnose it.

`internal/runsafe` recovers, logs the stack, and hands the failure to whatever
was running so it is marked failed rather than left at "running" forever. It is
wired into the two choke points every deployment and every provisioning
operation already pass through, into the backup, restore, volume-backup and
database goroutines beside the `fail` each of them already had, and into the
dispatcher. The three long-running loops recover per iteration rather than
around the loop: a panel that is alive with no scheduler is worse than one that
restarted, because nothing says so and the backups simply stop.

The test for it does not report a failure when it regresses. It takes the test
binary down, which is the point.

### The guards that stopped guarding

Four safety checks were written as `if err == nil && <the dangerous
condition>`, which reads as caution and means the opposite: the moment the query
behind the check fails, the check disappears and the destructive path runs. This
is the same shape as the capability-before-check pattern from Phase 18 — a
safety check that only runs when everything else is already well — and one of
these four was that pattern as well.

* **Deleting a database** skipped the "apps still use this" check when the links
  could not be read, and ran that check after the cluster capability check, so
  nothing could test it without a cluster. Both fixed; a test drops the
  `database_links` table and asks for the delete.
* **Restoring a backup** over a live database did the same thing with the same
  query. A failure to read the links is not an empty list of them.
* **Demoting the last owner** skipped the last-owner check when the membership
  or the owner count could not be read, leaving a team nobody can administer.
  Not being a member yet is the ordinary case and still passes; anything else
  now refuses. A test drops the `memberships` table.
* **Removing an owner** allowed it when the actor's own role could not be read.
  Nothing can reach that branch — `authorizeTeam` refuses a caller with no
  readable membership first — so there is no test for it, only the change. The
  ordinary guard, that an admin may not remove an owner, had no test either and
  has one now.

Two more in the same handler. Deleting a database asked which team it belonged
to *after* the row was gone, so the deletion was recorded with no team — filed
with the panel-wide events, which belong to no team by design, and shown in the
audit log of every team that person is in rather than in the one whose database
it was. And `dbsvc.Delete` removed the apps' database variables inside an
`if err == nil`, so a query failure left apps holding a connection string to
something that no longer exists, silently; it now says so.

`internal/errdoc` also had no tests. The catalogue is the product's central
promise — cause, impact and fix on every failure — and an entry missing one of
those still compiles and still renders. A test now reads the file as source and
checks every entry for all three, for a code shaped like a code, and for codes
that do not collide, since the UI picks a translation by code.

## Phase 21 — the competitors, researched properly

`docs/research/competitors.md` was written before the code and never checked
against the market again. Re-researched against live 2026 sources, it changed
the conclusions rather than confirming them.

* **Coolify disclosed eleven critical CVEs on 8 January 2026, five at CVSS
  10.0**, all authenticated command injection ending in root, plus a readable
  root SSH key and later a cross-team authorization bypass. Censys counted
  52,890 publicly reachable dashboards. The published cause is a class, not a
  mistake: user input reaching a shell in many independent code paths — which is
  exactly what `internal/shellsafe` exists for and exactly the bug found in this
  repository in September. ADR-0002a now records why there is one place for it.
* **Railpack is no longer a differentiator.** Dokploy ships it already, along
  with SSO/SAML that Skifity does not have.
* **aaPanel is not a competitor.** It replaces cPanel — websites, PHP, mail, a
  WordPress toolkit — and is sold to agencies running hundreds of client
  servers. It was researched and removed from the comparison rather than left in
  as a name.
* **Kubernetes is a category mismatch as much as an advantage.** Comparison
  sites exclude k3s from "self-hosted PaaS" as a different abstraction layer
  entirely, and one of the most-read 2026 guides is titled "Best Self-Hosted
  PaaS to Replace Heroku (No Kubernetes)". The audience is selecting away from
  what this is built on, which makes hiding it well the whole bet rather than a
  nice touch.
* **The footprint gap is the clearest measurable win.** 35 MiB against Coolify's
  500 MB–1.2 GB and Dokploy's ~350 MB.
* **Eight templates against Coolify's 280+** is the single most-cited reason
  people choose Coolify, and it is a content problem rather than an engineering
  one.

## Phase 22 — the catalogue, closed

Eight templates against Coolify's 342 was the largest gap we had, and the
research said it was a content problem rather than an engineering one. It was
both: a Go literal is fine for eight and impossible for three hundred, which is
why Coolify's catalogue is files and grew by contribution.

* **The catalogue is data now.** `internal/templates/catalogue`, one YAML file
  per template, embedded at build time. Adding one touches no Go, and the
  directory's README has the format and the two rules that are not obvious.
* **212 templates**, up from eight. 204 were converted from Coolify's catalogue
  by `hack/import_templates.py`, which is kept so the next batch is a re-run.
* **Every image was resolved to a version and verified.** `hack/resolve_tags.py`
  asks each registry for the tags, prefers a series tag that takes patches over
  an exact pin, and then fetches the manifest to prove the tag exists. 225 of
  269 single-service templates resolved; the 44 that did not were dropped rather
  than shipped on `latest`. More than half of Coolify's own entries ship
  `latest`.
* **The database wiring was taken out, and that was a real bug.** A Compose file
  points an app at a sibling container — `DB_HOST=mariadb` — and here the
  database is a managed one that arrives as a connection string. The first
  import carried those over, which would have produced apps that start, fail to
  resolve a hostname nobody recognises, and crash-loop. Bookstack, GLPI,
  Metabase, Redmine and Keycloak were all affected. A test now refuses any
  variable that names a datastore and ends in an address.
* **Nothing was shipped half-filled.** Templates with several application
  services (72), no port (15), or no verifiable image (46) were dropped.
* **The panel did not get heavier**: 34 MiB idle and 39.4 MiB of binary, against
  35 MiB and 39.3 MiB before.

What this does not mean: none of these has been deployed, because nothing in
this product has. What is checked is that each template is structurally sound
and that its image exists.

## Phase 23 — CI had been red on every commit

Twenty-three runs, all of them red, back to the first. Nobody looked, including
whoever wrote `make check`.

The failure was one step: `govulncheck`. `go.mod` said `go 1.26.0`, CI's
setup-go installs exactly what `go.mod` asks for, and Go 1.26.0 shipped with 21
known standard-library vulnerabilities that 1.26.1 fixed — one of them reachable
from `internal/notify`, which dials TLS to send mail. Locally the same command
passed, because `go run …@latest` quietly switches to a newer toolchain and the
scan then reports the newer standard library. The local answer and the CI answer
were about two different Go versions.

Two things were wrong, and the second is worse:

* **The `go` directive named a version with known holes.** It now names a patch
  release, so anyone building this gets a fixed standard library rather than
  whichever one they happen to have.
* **`make check` did not run the step that was failing.** It is documented as
  "what CI runs" and it was not: no `audit`. A gate with a hole in it looks
  exactly like a gate. `check` now includes it.

And the consequence nobody would have guessed from the summary line: because
`govulncheck` runs before them, **the race-detector run, both smoke tests and
the Playwright interface test had never executed on CI**. With the scan fixed
they ran, and all of them passed — except one step that had never run anywhere,
on any machine, and was broken in two ways.

### `make image` had never worked

Building the image needs a Docker daemon, and nothing here has one, so the whole
target was unverified for as long as it existed. The first CI run that ever
reached it failed twice over:

* The frontend stage builds from `web/` alone, and the frontend build copies
  `llms.txt` in from the repository root so the panel can serve it. The
  Dockerfile never copied that file, so the build stopped on a missing file that
  is right there in the repository.
* `.dockerignore` excluded `docs`, which is a Go package — `docs/embed.go`
  embeds the pages into the binary — so even past the first failure the backend
  stage would have failed on a missing import.

Both are the same shape as everything else in this log: a path nothing executes,
so nothing contradicts it. `internal/buildctx` now holds two tests that read the
Dockerfile and the ignore file rather than running Docker: every `//go:embed`
path must survive the build context, and anything the frontend build reads from
outside `web/` must be copied in.

This is also the path the quick start tells somebody to use, since nothing is
published — clone, `make image`, run the installer from inside the clone. It
would not have worked for them either.

## Phase 24 — the multi-service templates, and what they were worth

Seventy-two templates in Coolify's catalogue install more than one application
service. Installing several apps from one template was never the problem —
`installTemplate` already creates an app per service — so this was a converter
problem, and the converter kept being confidently wrong.

The first attempt produced 21 templates. They looked fine and were not: a
Sidekiq worker marked public on the web app's port, Elasticsearch given Kibana's
port, n8n given Postgres's, HeyForm given Redis's. Every heuristic fix revealed
another wrong guess, because a Compose file encodes a topology and the converter
was inferring one.

So it stopped inferring. A service's port now comes from the source saying so —
its own `SERVICE_FQDN` marker, or `expose`, or `ports` — or from a short table of
ports that are documented facts about an image, and that table only answers when
the image appears once in the stack (seaweedfs runs a master and an admin from
one image, and 8333 was wrong for both). Anything else is dropped as ambiguous.

That leaves **seven**, and all seven are right. It also produced three real
changes to the product rather than the converter:

* **`link_to` is a list.** A web app and its worker share one database, and
  linking only the first left the worker starting without the variable it cannot
  run without — the same crash loop as a link that names nothing.
* **A worker is `port: 0`**, which the manifest builder already handled: no
  Service, no probes, no ingress. The catalogue tests now allow it, and refuse a
  service that is public or has a health path with no port to check it on.
* **A shared volume does not carry over**, and that is said rather than
  discovered. A Compose volume is shared between services; a Skifity volume
  belongs to one app and is read-write-once, so Chatwoot's web app and its
  Sidekiq get two different `/app/storage` directories. The template says so and
  points at object storage.

Of the 65 that did not convert: 8 need the Docker socket, which cannot run under
a restricted pod security policy at all; 8 are stacks of five to twenty-three
services where getting startup order and shared state right without ever running
them is not a bet worth making; the rest have an image whose version could not be
verified or a service nothing says the port of.

## Phase 25 — the rest of the catalogue, and five resolver bugs

Seven multi-service stacks out of seventy-two, and 44 single-service templates
dropped for an unverifiable image, both looked like the source being awkward.
Most of it was this code being wrong, and each bug read in the log as somebody
else's fault.

**A tag can contain a colon.** `${IMMICH_VERSION:-release}` does, so splitting
the reference on the last colon produced the repository name
`ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-server:${IMMICH_VERSION`, and every registry answered
403. In the log that is the registry refusing us. It was eleven images, Immich,
Outline, Ente and Campfire among them.

**A registry's token comes from its own challenge.** ghcr.io and codeberg.org
were hardcoded and everything else — flipt, rocket.chat, weaviate, gcr.io,
outline, the Docker Hub mirrors — read as "unauthorized", which is what a
registry says when nobody asked it for a token. Reading `WWW-Authenticate` and
asking the realm it names works everywhere.

**A 429 is not "no".** Several vanity registries are pull-through caches in front
of Docker Hub and share its anonymous rate limit. Treating the rate limit as "the
image does not exist" dropped templates whose images were fine. It now backs off
and retries, and a question the registry never answered is recorded as
unverified rather than as absent.

**A tags listing is paginated.** Reading the first page picked
immich-machine-learning v1.132.3's server beside a v1.106.4 model runner — both
tags exist, the stack does not work, and upstream requires the two to match.
`Link` is followed now, and where a Compose file uses one version variable for
several images, the resolved tags are aligned and re-verified before any of them
is used.

**Not every project ships semver.** GitLab ships `19.1.8-ce.0`, SearXNG and
Excalidraw ship dates, DokuWiki ships `version-2026-07-14c`. Each names a build
exactly; insisting on semver threw all of them away. The fallback only applies
where the listing is newest-first, which the Hub API promises and a v2
`tags/list` does not, and it refuses an architecture (`linux-arm-v7`), a runtime
(`php8.3-apache`), a branch build (`…-chore-dependabot-security-36cd703`), a
toolchain variant (`3.8-python3.14-conda`) and anything longer than four parts.
Cockpit publishes `core-` and `pro-` from one repository, so the original tag's
prefix is kept as well.

And the converter stopped needing a port to be in `ports:` to count as written
down:

* **A `SERVICE_FQDN` marker does not have to match the service name.** Coolify
  writes `SERVICE_FQDN_CWA_8083` on a service called `calibre-web-automated`.
  Requiring the names to match was really defending against a shared environment
  block — a web app and its Sidekiq declared with one YAML anchor carry the same
  marker — and that case is visible in the data, so it is counted instead.
* **A healthcheck against localhost states a port.** `curl -fs
  http://localhost:8083` only makes sense if 8083 is open.
* **A peer states a port.** `PLAYWRIGHT_DRIVER_URL=ws://browser-sockpuppet-chrome:3000`
  and `ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200` each name a service and the
  port it answers on. Matching the host against the service's own name is what
  keeps this from being the environment-scanning that once gave n8n Postgres's
  port: a bare `DB_PORT=5432` names nothing and is ignored.

A peer beats a healthcheck, because the peer's port is the one other apps have to
reach: ZooKeeper's healthcheck talks to its admin server on 8080, which answers
`ruok` and nothing ClickHouse wants.

**282 templates**, up from 230 — 38 of them multi-service, up from seven. Three
more fixes to the output rather than the converter:

* **A worker keeps no port it did not declare.** A healthcheck that shells out,
  or a peer reference naming the web app, is not a worker declaring a port, and
  `openpanel-worker` was public on 3000 before this. A test now refuses any
  service named for a worker that is public.
* **A datastore is not linked to the database.** ClickHouse, MinIO, Meilisearch
  and a headless Chrome do not read a `DATABASE_URL`, and handing one to
  ClickHouse says the analytics store depends on the Postgres, which is not true.
* **A UDP port is not an ingress, and 80000 is not a port.** Palworld publishes
  `8211/udp` and Coolify's metadata says healthchecks listens on 80000. Both
  would have produced a domain that never answers.

## Phase 26 — the unverified images, and what the catalogue says about itself

Forty-three images could not be verified, which sounded like forty-three
upstreams being careless. Four more bugs, one of them shipping:

* **A reference with no tag has no tag.** `busybox` rpartitions to `("", "",
  "busybox")`, and taking that as the tag made the resolver answer "already
  pinned" for the most floating reference there is. Nothing reached the
  catalogue — the writer's own gate refuses an image with no tag — but the
  resolver was telling itself the opposite of the truth.
* **A pinned tag still has to exist.** Coolify's Mealie template names
  `3.17.0`; Mealie publishes `v3.17.0`. Trusting "already pinned" dropped a
  template whose current release was one lookup away.
* **The registry and the Hub API have different limits.** A manifest fetch
  counts against Docker Hub's anonymous pull limit and an API call does not, so
  a vanity host in front of Hub — docker.flipt.io, registry.rocket.chat,
  cr.weaviate.io — could answer 429 forever while the tag was plainly there.
  Asking the Hub API instead recovered Rocket.Chat, Weaviate and Flipt without
  pulling anything.
* **Nothing ever asked whether the catalogue was still true.** A tag that
  existed at import can be deleted afterwards, and MinIO did exactly that to its
  old RELEASE tags on Docker Hub. `hack/verify_catalogue.py` now asks every
  registry about every image in the directory: 290 of 291 present, 0 gone, 1
  rate-limited. It is not in `make check` — CI has no business depending on
  Docker Hub being up, and the anonymous limit would make it flaky — so it is a
  thing somebody runs before a release.

**282 templates**, 38 of them multi-service.

What stays dropped: 8 stacks need the Docker socket, which cannot run under a
restricted pod security policy; 4 are five to twenty-three services; 36 images
have no tag this could verify — `tiredofit/freescout` and `ghcr.io/ente-io/web`
are gone or private, Prefect publishes only toolchain variants, and Excalidraw,
Fizzy and label-studio publish nothing but branch builds. Shipping any of them
means guessing, and the whole point of the previous phase was that guessing is
worse than dropping.

### The number in the prose was wrong, and nothing failed

The README said 219 while the directory held 279. It had been wrong for two
phases. Every count this repository states about the catalogue — in the README
and in `docs/templates.md` — is now read back from the catalogue by a test, and
it caught the next drift on the same afternoon.

### Three things the panel did not say

Thirty-eight multi-service templates made three gaps visible that seven had hidden:

* **A card said `3210 · 6791 · 26.2.4.23 · postgres`.** Joining every service's
  tag with a dot says nothing and looks like a fault. One app still shows its
  version; a stack shows how many apps it is.
* **Installing four apps ended on `/projects`**, with no sign of where they
  went. It now lands on the app when there is one and on its project when there
  are several, and says how many were made.
* **A template's notes were shown before installing and never again.** They are
  the steps Skifity cannot do for you — a bucket to create, a migration to run,
  a shared directory that is two directories here — and the moment they matter
  is after the install, not before it. The comment on the field said they
  "appear after installation"; they did not. They do now, on the page the
  install lands on, until dismissed.

## Phase 27 — reliability and security, looked at properly

Three real defects, one of them a panic with a trigger anybody could hit by
accident, and two spot checks turned into complete ones.

### A closed browser tab could end a deployment

`Hub.Publish` collected its subscribers under the lock, released it, and then
sent. Between those two steps a client whose request context had just ended had
its channel closed by the goroutine watching that context — and a send on a
closed channel is a panic, in whatever happened to be publishing. A build emits
thousands of log events; closing the tab during one is all it takes. The panic
is contained by `internal/runsafe`, so the panel survives, but the deployment
that was publishing does not.

Reproduced in about three hundred iterations of subscribe-and-cancel, and it is
now a test that does exactly that. The sends happen under the lock, which is
safe because every one of them is non-blocking: the default arm drops the event
rather than waiting, so the section never sleeps.

### The third setting that becomes a request, and did not go through netguard

`internal/netguard`'s own comment said "two settings hold an address the panel
then makes a request to". There are three. The URL a cluster component's
manifest is downloaded from is a setting, `ApplyManifestURL` fetched it with
`http.DefaultClient`, and **what comes back is applied to the cluster as
Kubernetes objects** — which makes it the worst of the three to have been able
to point at `169.254.169.254`. It goes through the guarded client now, a scheme
that is not http or https is refused before anything is dialled, and a test asks
for the metadata service and for loopback and requires a `netguard.Blocked`.

### Two things a restart left in progress forever

A deployment interrupted by a panel restart is marked failed at startup, and so
is a provisioning operation. A **backup** written as `running` and a **database**
written as `creating` were not, and they are the same shape: a row only the
goroutine holding it ever finishes. The panel is a Deployment with a self-upgrade
endpoint, so a restart is routine rather than exotic.

The database is the worse of the two. One stuck at `creating` cannot be backed
up either — the backup manager refuses a target that is not running — so it is
not merely wrong on screen, it is unusable, and the only way out was to delete it
and start again.

### A key id longer than the header could hold

The envelope header carries the key id's length in one byte, and the id comes out
of the master key file, which an operator edits by hand. Nothing checked it: a
longer id would have been written truncated, every secret sealed afterwards would
have been unopenable, and the first sign of it would have been a decryption
failure on rows that were written correctly weeks earlier. The keyring refuses
one now, at both boundaries, and `encode` refuses to truncate rather than doing
it quietly.

### Two spot checks became complete ones

`TestNothingIsReachableWithoutCredentials` named seven paths out of a hundred and
twenty-three. `TestOneTeamCannotReachAnother` named thirty-three. The route that
matters is always the one nobody thought to add, so both now walk the router:

* **112 routes** refuse an anonymous request; 8 are open on purpose, each with a
  reason written next to it, and a second test fails if one of those 8 stops
  being a route this panel serves.
* **84 team-scoped routes** answer 404 for another team's team, project,
  environment, app, database or server — not 403, which would confirm the thing
  exists.

Neither found a hole. That is the point of running them: "authorization lives in
one place" was a claim about a hundred and twenty-three routes checked at seven.

### What was looked at and was already right

Argon2id at the OWASP parameters, sign-in lockout per account *and* per address
with the correct password refused while locked, constant-time comparisons,
unknown accounts indistinguishable from wrong passwords, CSRF double-submit with
bearer tokens exempt, `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite` on the session cookie, a
strict CSP, request body limits, HMAC-verified webhooks, SQLite on WAL with a
busy timeout and every write serialised through one mutex, and `runsafe` on every
background goroutine including the four launched as method calls that a grep for
`go func` misses.

Three things gosec reports here are not findings: SHA-1 in `internal/auth/totp.go`
is what RFC 6238 specifies, the CSRF cookie is readable by the frontend because
that is how double-submit works, and `skifity.toml` is 0644 because it is meant
to be committed.

## Phase 28 — the one thing autoscaling needed and did not check

Scaling on a CPU or memory target reads the metrics API. Without it the
HorizontalPodAutoscaler sits at `<unknown>/70%`: the app never scales up under
load, never scales back down, and neither Kubernetes nor the panel says why.
k3s ships metrics-server by default and this install does not disable it, so
the common case is fine — but an operator who brought their own cluster,
disabled it, or is watching it crash-loop on a small node would have had
autoscaling that looked configured and did nothing.

That is the exact failure the scaling readiness checker exists for, and it was
the one thing the checker did not look at. It checks the eight ways an app
breaks when it is scaled — a read-write-once volume, SQLite, in-memory
sessions, a local-disk cache, local uploads, in-app cron, no health path, a
single instance — and not whether the cluster can supply the number it is meant
to scale on. It does now, as an error rather than a warning, with what to do
about it. Scale-to-zero is exempt: KEDA counts requests, not CPU.

## Phase 29 — single sign-on, and what building it found

**Dokploy has SSO and this did not.** It was the only feature on the competitor
list that was a straight absence rather than a trade-off, so it is built:
OpenID Connect, authorization code with PKCE, against whatever an operator
points it at — Okta, Entra, Authentik, Keycloak, Zitadel, Google.

SAML is deliberately not here. It is a second protocol, a second XML parser and
a second class of signature bug, and every provider a self-hosted panel is
likely to meet speaks OIDC.

Three things about it are load-bearing, because each is an auth bypass when it
is wrong, and none of them is code written here:

* The ID token's signature, issuer, audience and expiry are verified by
  `oidc.IDTokenVerifier`. A hand-rolled JWT check is the usual way to end up
  accepting `alg: none` or a token minted for somebody else's client.
* The nonce is generated per sign-in and has to come back inside the ID token,
  which is what makes a replay of an old one fail.
* The state is generated per sign-in, kept in a short-lived HttpOnly cookie, and
  **spent before the code is exchanged** — so resending the same callback cannot
  replay it.

The issuer is a setting, which makes it the **fourth** address an administrator
types that the panel's own process then connects to. It dials through
`internal/netguard` like the other three. The redirect URI comes from the Panel
URL setting rather than from the request's Host, which a caller controls: that
is the difference between a fixed redirect target and one somebody can register
under their own hostname.

### What building it found in the code that was already there

An account created by single sign-on has no password hash. Signing in with a
password was correctly refused — and refused with *"stored password hash is not
in the expected argon2id format"*, which tells an anonymous caller which
addresses are provider-only accounts. That is the exact enumeration
`TestUnknownAccountLooksLikeAWrongPassword` exists to prevent, arriving through
a new door. An empty hash now costs the same Argon2 hash, the same lockout
entry and the same `ErrInvalidCredentials` as any other wrong password.

`TestEveryRouteRefusesAnAnonymousRequest` caught the two new routes on the first
run, which is what a complete check is for: they are open on purpose, and now
say so with a reason next to each.

### And the sandbox claim that was never checked

ADR-0010 has said for months that this environment "refuses privileged
containers", so no cluster could ever run here. Checked today for the first
time: the container is root with nearly every capability, `docker` and `k3d` are
both installed, `/dev/kmsg` and `/dev/net/tun` are there. What actually blocks
it is the session's permission layer refusing to start a Docker daemon — a fact
with a remedy, rather than a wall. The ADR now says so. No cluster has been run
either way, so nothing else changes; what changes is that the reason written
down was not the real one.

## Phase 30 — the release pointed somewhere nobody owns

"Tag a release" was on the roadmap as *the image does not exist until the first
tag*. It was worse than that.

The release published to **`ghcr.io/skifity/skifity`**, and the README two pages
away says plainly that there is no such repository — this one lives at
`TegarTheGreat/Skifity`. So a tag would either fail, or succeed into a namespace
nobody here owns and tell every installer to pull from a name **somebody else
could register**. That is not a missing artefact; it is a supply-chain hazard
written into the release configuration, sitting next to a document that already
knew.

The release now publishes to the repository it is cut from: the workflow derives
`IMAGE_REPO` from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, lowercased for ghcr.io, and GoReleaser
uses that for the image, the upgrade command in the release notes, and the
`image.source` label. Right wherever it is released from, and no decision taken
here.

One thing is still a decision rather than a fix, and it is flagged rather than
guessed: `installer/install.sh` carries a literal default, and a shell script a
stranger downloads cannot derive one. That line has to name wherever the project
actually publishes, which is choosing the project's public home.

### And the half of "a second pair of eyes" that can be arranged

The roadmap has asked since Phase 17 for somebody who did not write any of this
to look at the security model. **CodeQL** now runs on every push and weekly with
`security-extended` — a different analyser with a different model of the code,
reading taint from source to sink across packages, reporting into the Security
tab where a finding cannot be quietly forgotten. **Dependabot** opens the update
before `make audit` has to report it, grouped so a Kubernetes bump is one pull
request rather than twelve.

Neither is a person. A tool that agrees with the author is not evidence that the
author was right, and the roadmap still says so.

**And it was switched off.** The workflow said `branches: ["main"]`, and this
repository has no `main` — the work is on a branch, and Dependabot opens its
pull requests against that branch. So the scan never ran once. The first green
pull request is what made it visible: eight checks passed and CodeQL was not one
of them. It runs on every branch now, like CI does.

That is the same shape as `make check` not running `audit`, as the four cluster
smoke tests that were named and never written, as `make image` never having
worked: **a gate with a hole in it looks exactly like a gate**, and this one was
added in the same session that wrote that sentence down again.

## Phase 31 — the check that settles it, written

The largest open item in this repository is that nothing has ever run against a
real cluster. It cannot be closed from here — the environment refuses to start a
Docker daemon, and the server offered for it is not reachable from this
container, which serves HTTPS through a proxy and has no SSH client at all.

What can be written is the check itself, so that closing it is one command
somebody runs rather than an afternoon of improvisation. `test/cluster/verify.sh`
installs Skifity on a real server, deploys a real application, and then settles
the three things only a cluster can:

1. **An app comes up and answers.** Not that the manifest renders — that the pod
   starts, the Service routes, and an HTTP request gets a reply.
2. **Autoscaling has numbers to scale on.** It waits a minute for the HPA's
   first sample and fails if it is still `<unknown>`. That is the silent failure
   Phase 28 added a warning for; this is what proves the warning is right.
3. **Scale to zero is wired the way it is drawn.** KEDA running, an
   HTTPScaledObject for the app, and the app's own HPA *gone* — two autoscalers
   on one Deployment fight, and this is where that stops being a claim.

It also measures what the thing costs. `docs/performance.md` says 35 MiB idle,
measured on a laptop; this prints the first number measured on a cluster, and if
they disagree the document is what changes.

It is not in `make check` and never will be: it needs a machine to destroy,
several minutes and the internet, and it asks for a typed `yes` before touching
anything. `make verify` runs it. The release is not tagged until it passes.

## Phase 32 — the screenshots, and the page that had never been opened

A request for pictures of every screen. Taking them found that one of the
screens did not work.

### The Templates page threw on every install

`"databases": null`. A nil slice in Go marshals as `null`, and **157 of the 282
templates have no database**. The panel iterated it, threw
`TypeError: t.databases is not iterable`, and the error boundary rendered "This
page stopped working" where the catalogue should be.

It had been that way since the catalogue grew past the eight hand-written
entries — all eight of which happened to have a database. So the single
most-cited reason people choose a panel in this category, the thing three phases
of work went into, **has been a crash the whole time.**

Nothing caught it, and the reasons are worth writing down because they are all
the same reason:

* The structural tests in `internal/templates` read the Go value. The difference
  was in the JSON.
* The interface test checked the shell and the empty states. It had never opened
  the page.
* The screenshot capture is skipped by default, so the only thing that would
  have looked was switched off.

Fixed at both ends: the loader normalises nil slices to empty ones, because the
API's own type says these are arrays, and the page defaults them anyway — a
client that falls over on a shape it did not expect is the other half of the
same bug. A test now marshals every template and fails on a `null` list.

**And the guard that should have existed from the start:** the interface test
opens every page in the navigation and fails on an uncaught error or on the
error boundary being on screen. It deliberately asserts nothing about what each
page contains — that would be a second copy of the panel, out of date within a
week. It asserts only that the page renders, which is the thing that was not
true.

### The theme flash, in production only

The same run showed `Refused to execute inline script` in the console. `index.html`
carries one inline script: it reads the stored theme and adds the dark class
before the first paint, so a dark-mode user never sees a white flash. The policy
is `script-src 'self'` with no `'unsafe-inline'`, so **it never ran** — and the
white flash it exists to prevent happened on every load.

In production only. The policy is not set in dev mode, which is why it was
invisible to everybody who was looking.

The hash is now computed from the embedded `index.html` at startup and put in
the policy, so the two cannot drift: a hash written down beside a script goes
stale the first time somebody edits the script and does not think about the
policy. A test fetches the page and checks that the policy names every inline
script that ships, and that `script-src` still has no `'unsafe-inline'`.

### Two smaller things the pictures made obvious

* The template categories were shown as their slugs — `ai`, `cms`, `other`.
  Translated now, in all five languages, and sorted by the name somebody reads
  rather than by the slug underneath it.
* The autoscaling switch's description repeated its own label: "Scale
  automatically / Scale automatically".

**32 screenshots**, in `docs/tour.md`, captured by a test against the real
binary — so a picture can never show a screen that no longer exists.

## Phase 33 — the panel at 375px, and a team that could not be joined

A layout test at 375, 768 and 1440 (`web/tests/responsive.spec.ts`), and four
faults, none of them in hard code: the inset had no `min-w-0`, so the command
palette button's own width made every page on a tablet scroll 7px sideways; a
`Card` had none either, so a repository URL made the app page scroll 372px on a
phone with a `truncate` that could never apply; shadcn fixes a tab strip at one
row, so Settings' seven tabs wrapped out of the pill and onto the panel below;
and the switch, the checkbox and the breadcrumb links were all under the 24px
WCAG 2.2 (AA, 2.5.8) minimum. The test seeds a project, an app and a long secret
variable first, because an empty install has none of the shapes that break.

Separately, and larger: **there was no way to add anybody to a team.** Members
could be listed and their role changed; an account could only be made by
first-run setup, which happens once. An invitation is now a one-time link —
stored as a SHA-256, spent on use, expiring in seven days, carrying the address
it was issued for so an accept cannot be pointed at somebody else's account.

Also: a missing file was served `index.html` with a 200, which is how a browser
holding a cached page ends up parsing `<!doctype html>` as JavaScript; and
`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` was missing from an otherwise complete set of
headers.

## Phase 34 — what autoscaling did after it worked

Three faults on the scaling path, found by reading it against KEDA's own
manifests rather than against itself. All three are the same shape: an object
that renders correctly and a system that then behaves differently.

### Every apply undid the autoscaler

Objects are applied with server-side apply and `Force`, and the Deployment
carried `spec.replicas`. An apply happens on a deploy, a rollback, a variable
change, a domain change and a scaling change — so each of those reasserted the
panel's number over the autoscaler's. An app the HPA had taken to six under load
dropped to its minimum because somebody edited a variable, then climbed back
over the next few minutes. With scale to zero it was the mirror image: a
sleeping app forced awake and billed for it.

The field is now omitted whenever an autoscaler owns it, which is what
Kubernetes documents for this case. The test that existed asserted the old
behaviour — "the Deployment must start at the minimum" — which is why nothing
ever failed.

### A sleeping app could not be woken

An app that scales to zero is reached through an ExternalName Service aliasing
KEDA's interceptor. That alias said `port: 80` with `targetPort: 8080`, and the
Ingress asked for port 80.

`targetPort` is not applied to an ExternalName Service: no kube-proxy rule is
made for one, so the ingress controller dials whatever number it settles on —
Traefik the Service's `port`, nginx the number in the Ingress backend. Both
would have dialled port 80 of a proxy that listens on 8080 and nothing else.
Every request to an app that could sleep would have been a 502, and the app
would never have started. KEDA's own example points an Ingress at 8080 and gives
the alias no ports at all; this now says 8080 in all three places, which is the
only value that is right under every reading.

### A percentage target of a number nobody chose

A CPU or memory target is a percentage of what the app *reserves*. A new app
reserves 50m and 128Mi, so a 70% target fires at 35m and 90Mi — under what most
frameworks use while idle. Autoscaling would therefore "work" by going straight
to the ceiling and staying there. The readiness checker now does that arithmetic
and says the numbers out loud, and `docs/concepts.md` explains it.

`test/cluster/verify.sh` gained the two checks that would have caught the first
two: it scales an app to three, changes a variable and fails if the count moves;
and it puts an app to sleep, sends one request through the real ingress and
fails unless the app answers and comes back. The second used to be a sentence
telling the operator to try it by hand.

### The other half of a zero-downtime deploy

`maxUnavailable: 0` keeps the capacity, and the test that checks it said that is
"what makes a deploy zero-downtime". It is half of it. A pod is removed from its
Service and told to stop at the same moment, and the ingress controller learns
about the removal through a watch — so for a fraction of a second it is still
sending requests to a process that has begun shutting down. Every rolling update
therefore dropped a handful of requests, which is the kind of thing nobody can
reproduce afterwards.

There is now a five-second `preStop` pause before SIGTERM, out of the same
thirty-second grace period. A sleep action rather than a shell command, because
a distroless image has no shell; and only for an app that serves HTTP, because a
worker has no endpoint for anybody to notice disappearing.

### The front door, said out loud

Every server runs the ingress, so an app answers on every server's address. DNS
names one. If an app has three instances across three servers and the server the
domain points at goes down, the app is running and the name is dead — Kubernetes
moved the work, it cannot move a DNS record.

Nothing in the documentation said this, and `docs/research/competitors.md`
criticised Coolify for the same thing without admitting it. Both now say it, and
`docs/adding-servers.md` gives the three ways out: round-robin DNS, a floating
IP, or a provider's load balancer, with the address going in
**Settings → Domains → Cluster public IP**.

## Phase 35 — the checklist, crosschecked

Eighteen things a self-hosted platform is judged on, put against the code one at
a time. `docs/checklist.md` is the result and the record: three statuses, and
only three — **Works** means a test that runs on every push, **Written** means
the code and its unit tests exist and it has never touched a cluster, **Missing**
means missing. Nothing is Works because it looks right.

Two of the eighteen are Works end to end. Most are Written. That ratio is the
honest state of this product and it does not change until `verify.sh` has run.

### The one that was Missing

Taking the data out. "Can I take my data with me" was answered by "copy
`panel.db` and `master.key`", which is a Skifity-shaped blob and a promise
rather than an export. `skifity export` now writes a directory that needs none
of this product to read: the whole team as JSON, and each app as the Kubernetes
objects it would be applied as. Secret values are deliberately not in it — the
promise that a stored secret is never shown again is worth more than the
convenience, and it costs nothing, because those values are already in the
reader's own cluster as ordinary Kubernetes Secrets.

### And the crosscheck itself, made runnable

`test/cluster/verify.sh` was a script that had never been run, and reading it
against the code showed why that matters: it asked for an API token with the
wrong CSRF header name, without the team id the endpoint requires, and then read
the secret out of a field that does not exist. It would have died four checks
in, and everything after it would never have run.

It is now organised as the five phases a person can actually work through, and
covers what it claimed to and more: a build from Git rather than a prebuilt
image, a build log read while it is still building, an address that answers, a
variable change that restarts without rebuilding, a rollback, two hundred
requests held across a rolling restart, a volume that survives one, a database,
a backup restored, the export, a token refused on another team, a member refused
the settings, one namespace refused another's app, sixty-four cores refused by
the quota, the panel scaled to zero while the app keeps serving, a node drained,
the panel replaced under a running app, and a deployment that cannot pull its
image sending a real notification to a real listener.

`test/cluster/sample-app` is what phase 1 builds: one Go file and a two-stage
Dockerfile with nothing to download, so a build failure is the builder's and not
the network's.

The parts of that script that only talk to the panel are now also covered by
`make smoke` against the real binary — the invitation flow end to end over HTTP,
what a member is refused, and the export. A field renamed in the API would
otherwise leave the crosscheck quietly checking nothing, on the one machine
nobody can run from CI.

## Phase 36 — the first five minutes

Three things a person who has never seen this would hit, found by walking the
path rather than by reading the code that implements it.

### The first screen told you to do what you had just done

`CreateServer` was called from exactly one place — the SSH provisioner — so the
machine Skifity installs itself onto was never recorded anywhere. A brand new
install opened on

> No servers yet — Add your first server

while looking at a panel served by a cluster that was already running on that
very machine. The only sensible thing to do next was to type its own address
into the form, which the preflight refused with a message about something
listening on port 6443. Correct, and no use at all as an answer.

The cluster's nodes are now adopted into the team when it is created: listed
like any other server and not managed like one. The row carries `adopted`,
because the panel has no key to that machine and put nothing on it — so Remove,
Retry and Promote refuse with a reason (`server.not_ours`) rather than failing
at the SSH connection with what reads like a network problem, and the panel does
not offer the buttons at all.

### "New app" was a button on a page nobody was standing on

Creating an app only existed inside a project's page, two lists deep. The quick
start said *"Press New app"* in step 3, describing a button that is not on the
screen it had just walked the reader to. It is now on the overview and in the
command palette, pointing at the first project's first environment — the one
setup creates.

### Five settings that nothing read

Settings → Git offered a GitHub App ID, a slug, a client id, a client secret and
a private key. Nothing in the repository read any of them: there is no JWT
signed with that key and no installation token exchanged for it. An operator
could paste a private key and have nothing happen, and the client id's help text
promised signing in with GitHub and a list of repositories to choose from,
neither of which exists.

They are gone, along with `github_app` as a connection kind and the webhook
branch that verified pushes for a kind of connection the panel could not create.
A personal access token is the path that works, for GitHub, GitLab and Gitea,
and it is the one the panel offers. Same shape as Compose in phase 19 and the
WireGuard fallback before it: the feature was the settings page.

`verify.sh` now checks the first of these where it means something — a fresh
install must list the machine it is running on, and must mark it adopted.

## Phase 37 — the first command, and the first click

### The link the installer prints now does the copying

Every self-hosted install ends the same way: a URL, a forty-character token, and
a minute of moving one into the other. The installer prints a link with the
token in it instead. In the `#fragment`, deliberately — a fragment is never sent
to a server, so opening it cannot put the token into an access log, a proxy or a
`Referer` header on the way somewhere else. The page reads it during render and
clears the address bar, so a bookmark or a screen share does not keep it. The
plain URL and the token are still printed underneath.

**Writing the test for that found an older bug.** The installer has always
printed `<url>/setup`, and `/setup` is not a route: the setup screen is a gate
in front of the router, so once an account exists the gate is gone and the path
has nothing behind it. Everybody who followed the printed link finished first-run
setup and landed on "Not found". `/setup` and `/login` now redirect to the
overview.

### The panel hands out its own binary

One file is the panel, the CLI and the MCP server, so the file answering a
request is the file somebody wants on their PATH. `GET /api/cli/download`
streams it.

The installer used to fetch the CLI from `github.com/skifity/skifity/releases`,
which does not exist, so every install ended with "could not download the
command line tool" and a link to nothing. It now asks the panel it has just
started: always present, always the matching version — a CLI one release behind
its panel is a confusing afternoon — and no internet needed at all.
`SKIFITY_CLI_URL` remains for an air-gapped mirror. `make smoke` downloads it,
runs it, and fails if the version differs from the panel's.

### The domain nobody pointed yet

`SKIFITY_DOMAIN` used to be taken at its word. A record that does not point at
this server means Let's Encrypt cannot answer the challenge, and the operator
learns that ten minutes later from a cert-manager log, as a browser warning on
a page they cannot open. One `getent` lookup at install time says it now, with
the address the record should have. A warning rather than a stop: installing
first and pointing DNS afterwards is entirely reasonable.

### One click meant one click and a decision

The template install dialog opened with the environment picker empty and the
button greyed out. Almost every panel has exactly one environment — setup makes
it — so the one-click catalogue began with a choice that had a single possible
answer. It is preselected when there is exactly one, derived during render
rather than copied into state, and left empty when there are several, because
installing into the wrong environment is not a mistake anybody notices
straight away. The label said "Environments"; it now says where it is going.

## Phase 38 — which systems, asked properly

"Does it work on every operating system" turns out to be four questions, and
three of them had an honest answer already. The fourth did not.

### Alpine was on the list of distributions that work, and could never work

`knownWorkingDistros` said AlmaLinux, Rocky, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE,
SLES, Alpine, Arch. Four lines below it, a missing systemd is a **fatal**
problem — and Alpine runs OpenRC. So the file promised a distribution and
refused it in the same breath. k3s itself supports OpenRC; Skifity does not,
because it manages the unit with `systemctl`.

Alpine is off the list, the refusal now names it and OpenRC by name, and a test
walks every remaining entry and fails if one of them is refused on an otherwise
healthy server. The same shape as the Compose claim and the WireGuard fallback:
a list is a promise.

### There was no CLI for Windows, for no reason

`goos: [linux, darwin]`. The binary is pure Go with cgo off, `os.UserConfigDir`
finds `%AppData%` by itself, and `GOOS=windows go build ./...` compiles clean on
the first try — it had simply never been asked for. Somebody deploying from a
Windows laptop needs the CLI as much as anybody, and the CLI, the MCP server and
the panel are one file. Six binaries now: linux, darwin and windows, amd64 and
arm64, with `.exe` spelled out in the release's name template rather than left
to a default.

The panel half is still Linux only, which is not a gap: what it installs is
Linux.

### `make image` built for whatever machine ran it

The release builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` through buildx. `make image`
— the path everybody uses, since no release exists — passed no platform at all,
so an image built on an amd64 laptop for an arm64 VPS starts with "exec format
error". `PLATFORM=linux/arm64 make image` now does the obvious thing.

### And the answer, written down

`docs/quick-start.md` has the table: tested, expected-to-work, will-not-work,
and which architectures, for servers and for the CLI separately. `docs/faq.md`
has the short version. It was knowledge somebody had to read three Go files to
assemble.

## Phase 39 — what the research said, against what the code did

"Is every Linux distribution covered" was answered from memory in phase 38 and
checked against k3s's own documentation afterwards. Two of the answers were
wrong, and one of them was wrong in a way that would have taken a whole tier of
supported distributions down.

### firewalld did not exist anywhere in this repository

The firewall step knew two firewalls: ufw, and iptables as a fallback. firewalld
is the default on **AlmaLinux, Rocky, RHEL, CentOS and Fedora** — every one of
which this product lists as expected-to-work — and it is active out of the box
on their cloud images.

What happened on such a server: no ufw, so the fallback put rules in with
`iptables -I INPUT`. firewalld discards those on its next reload, and there is no
`netfilter-persistent` on those systems to survive a reboot either. The cluster's
ports were open until something touched the firewall, and then were not — which
is the worst shape a bug can have, because it works when you test it.

There are now three branches, each using its own tool the way its own users
would, decided once: ufw, firewalld with `--permanent` rich rules and a
`--reload`, iptables otherwise. And all three trust the pod and service networks
by CIDR, which is what k3s's documentation asks for and what the ufw branch only
half did with interface rules.

### The memory cgroup, which the kubelet cannot start without

k3s's requirements name it for Raspberry Pi OS, which ships with it off. Skifity
builds for arm64, so that is a path people take — and what k3s says on the way
out is about cgroups rather than about the one line in `cmdline.txt` to change.
Both preflights check it now, on cgroup v1 and v2, and the refusal carries the
line to add. Unknown is not treated as no: a server whose cgroups cannot be read
is not refused on a guess.

### And what the research confirmed rather than changed

* **k3s's install script does support OpenRC**, so k3s on Alpine works. Skifity
  does not, because it manages the service with `systemctl` — phase 38's
  reasoning was right and the wording now says whose limitation it is.
* The ports Skifity opens are exactly k3s's documented inbound list: 6443,
  10250, 8472, 51820, 51821, and 2379–2380 on control plane servers.
* `nm-cloud-setup` on RHEL was a real problem and its last affected release
  reached end of life in May 2023; not worth a check.
* armhf is supported by k3s and not by Skifity, which builds only 64-bit — and
  the preflight already refuses it.

## Phase 40 — the catalogue had no pictures

Three hundred cards, each with a grey square and one letter in it. Every product
in this category shows logos, and the catalogue is the single most-cited reason
people choose one.

**211 of the 282 templates now have one**, from
[homarr-labs/dashboard-icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons) —
the collection Homarr, Homepage and Dashy all draw on, and CC0-1.0, which is
what makes vendoring it possible at all. The remaining 71 show the letter, which
is what the fallback was always for.

**They are committed, not fetched.** The panel's own policy says
`img-src 'self'`, and pointing at a CDN would mean widening it, telling that CDN
which self-hosted apps each user is browsing, leaving an offline install without
pictures, and making somebody else's uptime a thing that makes this product look
broken. 2.5 MB inside a 40 MB binary buys all four back. SVG where the
collection has one and WebP where it does not: a 260 KB PNG drawn at 40 pixels
is a waste nobody sees and everybody carries.

Nothing in the YAML changed. An icon is a file named after the template it
belongs to, so adding one is adding a file; the loader looks and fills in
`Icon`, and `hack/fetch_icons.py --report` names the ones still missing.

### And a measurement that lied, again

The first check counted images that were `complete && naturalWidth > 0` and
reported **200 of 211 broken**. They were not: `loading="lazy"` means an image
below the fold has not been fetched, and counting that as failure is the same
mistake as guessing at a layout instead of measuring it. Asking the endpoint for
all 211 directly gives 0 failures, and that is what the interface test does now —
it also checks that a template *without* a logo answers 404 rather than putting
a broken image on every card.

## Phase 41 — the front door, answered properly

`docs/adding-servers.md` listed three ways to keep one address alive when a
server goes down: round-robin DNS, a floating IP, a provider's load balancer.
Researched against how each actually behaves, that list was wrong in two ways.

**It was missing the best answer for this audience.** Cloudflare Tunnel:
`cloudflared` in the cluster with two or three replicas, each making outbound
connections to Cloudflare. Kubernetes already spreads those across servers, so
failover needs no configuration and no health check — and it needs **no public
IP and no inbound ports at all**, which makes a server behind NAT or on a home
connection work. Free to 25 replicas. The trades are written down too: traffic
goes through Cloudflare, replicas are steered by geography rather than round
robin, and the free plan caps an upload at 100 MB.

**And it did not warn about the thing people try first.** kube-vip and MetalLB
in layer-2 mode hold a virtual IP by answering ARP, and ARP does not cross a
router. Every node has to be on one segment *and* the provider has to route that
extra address to you — which on cloud VPS is exactly what a floating IP is, sold
as a product. Their BGP modes work, and need a provider that speaks BGP to you.
On bare metal in one rack they are the right answer; between providers they are
not, and somebody was going to spend an evening finding that out.

Round-robin DNS is also described for what it is now: a failover for a server
that is **off**, not one that is **sick**. A machine that accepts a connection
and then answers nothing is one DNS keeps handing out.

## Phase 42 — the front door, built

Phase 41 wrote down that Cloudflare Tunnel was the right answer for this
audience and left the reader to install it. That is the shape every dead
integration in this repository started as: a paragraph of documentation and five
settings nothing read.

So it is a component now. **Settings → Components → Cloudflare tunnel** renders
a Secret and a Deployment into the panel's own namespace: two replicas, spread
across hosts with `ScheduleAnyway` so a one-server cluster still gets both,
`maxUnavailable: 0` so a rollout never takes a connector away before its
replacement is connected, `/ready` as the readiness and liveness probe because
"connected to Cloudflare" is not the same as "the process is running", no
service account token, and the token itself only ever in a Secret.

Three things make it a component rather than a page:

* **It refuses without a token.** `cloudflared` with no token starts, fails to
  authenticate, and restarts for ever while the panel says installed. Installing
  with nothing in the box returns `tunnel.no_token` with the four clicks that
  produce one.
* **The setting is validated where it is typed.** The dashboard shows the token
  inside a `cloudflared service install <token>` command line, and the tunnel's
  UUID is in the address bar above it. Both get pasted. Both are refused in the
  text box, each with the sentence that says which one this is.
* **Saving a new token changes what is running.** The token reaches the
  container as an environment variable, and an environment variable is read once
  at startup — so applying a new Secret under a running pod changes nothing at
  all. A fingerprint of the token is an annotation on the pod template, which
  makes a new token a new template and rolls the connectors the ordinary way.
  Clearing the token stops them and puts the component back to not installed,
  which is how every other integration in Settings is disconnected.

Nothing is needed per app. `cloudflared` forwards the Host header untouched and
the ingress routes on exactly that, so one wildcard public hostname pointed at
`traefik.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:80` covers every app that exists and
every app that ever will. That address is a constant in `internal/settings`
rather than a string in two places, because the operator has to type it into
Cloudflare and the help text must not drift from the code.

What is still manual, and is written down where somebody looking for it will
find it: creating the tunnel and adding that hostname. Doing those from the
panel needs a Cloudflare API token with Zero Trust permissions, which is a
second credential and a second integration — and this one has never been pointed
at a real Cloudflare account, so it is not the moment to add a third thing that
cannot be run here either.

## Phase 55 — the half of the panel that was never translated

"There is still a lot of i18n missing." There was, and not where the checker was
looking: every key existed in all five languages — 825 of them — and the largest
page in the panel was still entirely English, because its words do not come from
the locale at all. They come from the server.

### Settings, in English, in every language

`internal/settings` carries a label and a help paragraph for each of the
forty-three settings, and the panel showed them as they are. With the interface
in Indonesian the chrome read Pengaturan, Umum, Klaster — and every field under
it read "Panel URL", "Which builder to use when a repository has no
Dockerfile…". Six and a half thousand characters of English on the page an
operator spends the most time on. The screenshot of it is in `docs/images`,
before and after.

The server keeps its English: it has one language, and the API, the CLI and an
assistant all read those strings. The panel looks them up by the setting's own
key — `settings.field.<key>.label` — with the server's text as the fallback for
a setting added before anybody has translated it. Eighty-six strings, five
languages.

`TestEverySettingHasItsWordsInTheInterface` checks that every definition has
words in the interface **and that the English matches character for character**.
Two copies of the same sentence drift, and the one that drifts is the one nobody
reads.

### Two screen readers' worth of English, and a button nobody has pressed

The mobile sidebar's drawer announced itself as "Sidebar. Displays the mobile
sidebar." in all five languages: text inside an `sr-only` block rather than on
the tag carrying the class, which is the shape the checker did not look for. It
looks for it now, and the pattern found the other one — a `Close` button in the
dialog footer, hardcoded, behind a flag nothing passes today. A hardcoded
English button waiting for the first person to turn it on.

### Two deploy buttons, and the answer changing on a second look

Asked about, answered "that is the pattern", asked again, and looked again —
this time the answer is different, because the second look was at the screen
rather than at the other pages.

The pattern is real: Databases, Servers and Projects all repeat their primary
action in the empty state. On those pages the empty state **is** the page, so
the two buttons are obviously the same thing, because there is nothing else they
could be. The app page is not that: the empty state sits in a card titled
"Instances", among other cards, with "Deploy now" already in the header. A
second "Deploy now" inside a card about instances invites the reading that it
starts an instance without deploying — which is not a thing this panel does.

So the app page is the one place that does not repeat the action. The sentence
does the work instead, and names the button by its own label rather than in
English: it reads "Deploy sekarang" in Indonesian and "立即部署" in Chinese,
which is what the button at the top of that page actually says. The empty state
also has a title now rather than the logs tab's full sentence with a full stop
in it.

### What is still English, said plainly

* **Every error.** Ninety `errdoc.New` sites, each with a title, a cause, an
  impact and a fix — the panel's best writing, and none of it translated. It is
  the next piece, and it is larger than this one was.
* **The template catalogue.** Two hundred and eighty-two names and descriptions,
  which are mostly upstream product copy; the categories are translated.
* **A plugin's own manifest**, which belongs to whoever wrote it.

## Phase 54 — a page of snake_case, an app with no address, and a trail to nowhere

The project page, the app page and Activity, read the way somebody meets them.

### Activity was a column of machine codes

The page that answers "what happened" printed `app.scaling_changed`,
`variable.set`, `setup.completed` — the strings the database stores. On a panel
whose whole premise is that Kubernetes stays out of sight, the human page was
showing identifiers.

All seventy-two audit actions have words now, in five languages: "Scaling
changed", "Variable set", "Panel set up". The code stays on the hover, because
this is also the page somebody reads with a log open beside them, and a code
with no phrase falls back to itself — which is what every row used to be. The
audit tab in Settings shows the same phrases, so one thing is not called two
names in one product.

`TestEveryAuditActionHasWordsForIt` reads the actions out of this package's own
source and checks each one against the locale. Adding an action without a phrase
fails with the file it is in and the key to add.

The page also borrowed the audit tab's sentence — "Who did what, when, and from
where" — while deliberately not showing the address, and then repeated that same
sentence in its empty state.

### An app page that could not say where it was

The breadcrumb read "Overview › Apps", the title was the app's name, and nothing
anywhere named the project or the environment it belongs to. The only way back
to its project was the browser's back button.

It says "Storefront · Production" under the name now, with the project as a
link. Both queries are keyed so they come from the cache when anything else has
already asked.

Two more on the same page: the stat card was labelled "Instances" above a card
titled "Instances", and read "0 / 0" without saying which number was which — it
is "Instances ready" now. And "The panel is not connected to a cluster" was a
grey sentence floating between cards, while the same condition is an Alert on
the Overview page; it is an Alert here too, with a tone that follows the phase,
so a cluster that cannot be reached reads as a problem and "waiting for the new
instances" does not.

### A trail that pointed at the not-found page

The breadcrumb drops the ids — `/apps/app_06gb…` is noise — and rebuilds the
path from what is left. On the new-app page, `/environments/env_x/apps/new`,
that produced links to `/environments` and `/environments/apps`. Neither is a
page. Both were links.

A crumb is a link only when the path it would point at is one of the panel's
pages now, and a Playwright test walks every breadcrumb on every seeded page and
follows it, failing if it lands on the not-found page.

### The test that was testing an older build

`make e2e` depended on `backend`, which builds the binary against whatever is in
`web/dist`. Change a page, run the interface test, and it tests the build from
an hour ago — which is exactly what happened here: a tap target that was too
small kept failing after it had been fixed. There is a `ui` target now, and both
`e2e` and `screenshots` depend on it.

**Verified by looking:** the screenshots are recaptured, and the one that made
this pass worth doing is Activity — eight rows that used to be code.

## Phase 53 — the braces on the page, cron in a text box, and four sentences said twice

An interface pass, looking for what a person meets rather than what a test
covers: placeholders, flows, repeated words, and the controls that ask somebody
to know a syntax.

### `{{product}}`, on the page, in five languages

The app's Settings tab read "Most frameworks read it from the PORT variable,
which **{{product}}** sets for you". The same string on the New app page reads
correctly, because that call passes the value and this one did not. i18next has
nothing to say about a missing interpolation: it renders the braces and carries
on.

So `check:i18n` reads the call sites now. Every `t("…")` for a string with a
placeholder has to name each one, and the check is deliberately one-sided —
passing a value a string does not use is harmless; leaving one out is what
shipped.

### A schedule that asked you to know cron

A backup schedule and a scheduled command were both a text box containing
`0 3 * * *`. That asks every user to know five fields in the right order, and to
find out they were wrong at three in the morning when the backup they thought
they had did not happen.

Four presets cover what people pick — hourly, daily, weekly, monthly — and cron
stays behind "Custom" for the times they do not. The times say UTC, because a
schedule that quietly meant the server's idea of local time is a different
failure in every timezone. The list of scheduled commands shows the words rather
than the expression: a row reading `0 3 * * *` asks whoever is looking at it to
parse cron in their head.

One piece of local state survives the "derive, do not synchronise" rule, and it
is written down: which mode the control is in is derived from the value, except
for the moment somebody picks "Custom" while the box still holds a preset, which
is an intent no value can carry.

### The same sentence, twice on one screen

Four screens introduced themselves and then said it again:

* **Databases** used the apps' empty-state help as the page's own description,
  so the subtitle and the empty state were the same sentence.
* **Projects** and **Servers** did the same. Servers went further: its page
  description was the list of what a server needs — Ubuntu, a gigabyte, SSH as
  root — which belongs on the page where you add one, and already is there.
* The **Console** tab showed "Run a command" as a field label and again as a
  panel title, with its help text repeated word for word sixty pixels below.
  What that panel is for is output, so it says so now.
* The backup card labelled three different controls "Automatic backups": the
  card, the switch and the schedule. And "Keep the last" was a number with no
  unit.

### Two controls for one action

On Databases with more than one environment, the header button asks which one
and the empty state picked the first — and with no environments at all it called
`setCreating(null)`, which is a button that does nothing. Both are the same
control now.

### Advanced, two ways

Add a server opens its advanced section with a bordered row and a chevron. New
app had a bare ghost button that said "Show advanced" and then "Hide advanced" —
a different affordance for the same idea, two pages apart in one flow. It is the
same control now, and the dead `advanced` state is gone with it.

### The rest of what the pass found

New app described itself with the apps' empty-state text, which ends "or start
from a template" — a third path the form does not offer. The sentence says what
the page does, and the template path is a button beside it. The Dockerfile path
field was labelled "Dockerfile", which is the name of the builder option above
it. The sidebar had one group, headed "Overview", above an item called
"Overview". Documentation is the one link that leaves the panel and now says so.

**Verified by looking:** the screenshots are recaptured from the real binary,
and the console tab is in them now — the scheduled commands card had never been
photographed.

## Phase 52 — a command nobody waited for, an error cached forever, and a path the panel chose

An audit of `internal/mcpserver`, `internal/cli` and `internal/templates`.

### "It waits for the command to finish" — it did not

`skifity run -- npm run migrate` starts a Job and then reads its log. The read
did not pass `follow`, so the panel returned whatever the container had printed
by the time the pod was first seen running — which, for anything slower than the
two-second poll, is nothing. The CLI printed "Running: npm run migrate", a blank
line, and exited zero. Both it and the MCP tool said otherwise: the tool's
description reads "It waits for the command to finish and returns its output",
and the CLI's own comment said "the output comes back when the command is done".

An assistant reading an empty output as a successful migration is the worst
answer available, so this is the one that mattered most.

Both follow now. That needs a client without the ordinary one-minute deadline,
so `DoLong` exists beside `Do`: the wait belongs to the migration, not to the
network. The CLI has no cap and says that Ctrl-C stops the waiting rather than
the command; the MCP tool caps at ten minutes, because what is on the other end
is an assistant waiting on a tool call, and past the cap it says the command is
still running and where its output will be.

### An error that outlived its cause

The MCP server resolved the team once, with a `sync.Once` — which caches the
failure as happily as the success. An assistant that opened its editor while the
panel was restarting got the same error from every tool for the rest of the
session, and the only cure was restarting something nobody would think to
restart. Only success is kept now.

### The panel chose where the CLI wrote

`skifity export` writes `manifests/<namespace>/<app>.yaml` under the directory
the user named, and both the namespace and the slug come from the panel's own
JSON. `filepath.Join` cleans as it goes, so a namespace of `../../.ssh` becomes
a path beside the export rather than inside it, and the result looks perfectly
ordinary. It is the panel the user signed in to, so this is unlikely — and the
check is one line, while what it prevents is a file written over somewhere
nobody looked. `underneath` refuses anything that climbs out, with a test for
the cases that actually climb (one `..` is absorbed by the `manifests` element
and lands back inside; two are not).

### The tool table nobody checked

`llms.txt` prints the MCP tools, and that page is what an assistant is pointed
at. The API routes in the same document have been checked against the router
since Phase 22; the tool table was checked against nothing. It is now, in both
directions — a documented tool that does not exist, and an existing tool nobody
documented, both fail. Adding a row for a tool that is not there fails with its
name in the message.

`ReadIcon` sliced a file name at its last dot without checking there was one, in
the function whose comment says it checks the name anyway "because the one that
is not checked is the one that changes later". Now it does.

### What was checked and found sound

The catalogue is the best-gated part of this codebase: thirteen tests, including
that every image names a version rather than `latest`, that every database
reaches the service it is for, that every list is an array in JSON rather than
`null`, that every icon belongs to a template and can actually be served, and
that what the README says ships is what ships. The CLI's config file is written
0600 and a test reads the mode back; `SKIFITY_URL` and `SKIFITY_TOKEN` override
it for a CI job or an assistant; every command takes `--json` and a test walks
the package to prove it. The MCP tools go through the same API with the same
scoped token as the CLI, so an assistant can do what the token's owner can do
and nothing more.

## Phase 51 — the keyring under load, a code used twice, and the secrets rotation stepped over

An audit of `internal/api`, `internal/auth`, `internal/store` and
`internal/crypto`. Four real defects, three of them in the parts that are only
exercised on the day they matter.

### One keyring, no lock

The `Keyring` is shared by everything in the panel — the API, the deployer, the
backup manager, the cluster adapter — and rotation writes to its map while all
of them read it. There was no mutex. A Go map read during a map write is not a
race the program survives: the runtime **throws**, and a throw is not a panic,
so `runsafe.Recover` never sees it. Rotating the master key on a busy panel
could take the panel down, which is also the one thing that makes the cluster
unreachable.

The lock is held for every read of the map as well as every write, because
`DropKey` zeroes a key's bytes and a slice read after that is a key of zeros.
`BeginRotation` now picks the id, adds the key and promotes it under one lock:
two rotations started together would otherwise choose the same id, and the
second would fail after the first had already moved the active key.

The test runs four goroutines sealing and opening while five rotations run
through them. Under `-race` it fails on the old code and passes on the new, and
`make check` runs the race detector.

### The rotation stepped over the plugin secrets

`ListSealedSecrets` is the list master key rotation walks. It named eight
columns. The database has ten: `plugins.hmac_sealed` and the sealed rows in
`plugin_settings` were both missing — added by the plugin work three commits
earlier, and not added here.

The consequence is silent and permanent. Rotation drops the retired keys once
every secret it knows about has been rewrapped, so the two it did not know about
stay wrapped in a key that no longer exists. Nothing reports it. The first sign
would be plugins that quietly stop receiving events, because the panel can no
longer read the secret it signs them with.

Both are listed now, `SealedRef` carries a second key column for a row
identified by two, and `TestEverySealedColumnIsRotated` walks the schema the
panel actually creates: a column named `*_enc` or `*_sealed`, or a `value`
beside an `encrypted` flag, has to be in the list. Removing one line from the
list fails the test with the column's name in it.

### A two-factor code that worked twice

RFC 6238 says a one-time password is used once. The panel accepted a code for
the current thirty-second step and one either side, and recorded nothing, so a
code read over a shoulder, off a screen share or out of a proxy log stayed valid
for up to ninety seconds.

`VerifyTOTP` now returns the step it matched, and the step is spent in a single
statement — `UPDATE … WHERE totp_last_counter < ?` — so two sign-ins arriving
with the same code in the same instant cannot both win. The code that switches
two-factor on is spent as well, so it cannot be the code that gets past it a
moment later.

### A plugin heard about every team

A plugin is installed panel-wide by an owner, and the dispatcher sent every
subscribed plugin every event. On a panel with more than one team that means an
owner of one team could install a plugin and have it watch another team's
deploys — and, with a blocking hook, refuse them.

A plugin's token already belongs to whoever installed it, so it can read what
that person can read. The events draw the same line now: a plugin hears about a
team only when its installer is a member. An event that carries no team reaches
nobody, which is the safe direction, and both refusals are logged rather than
silent, because a plugin that receives nothing looks exactly like a plugin that
is broken.

### Two smaller things

Rotation ran on the request's context, so closing the tab halfway through
cancelled it: the secrets already rewrapped were fine, the rest kept the old key,
and nobody was told which was which. It runs on its own context now.
`SaveKeyring` wrote and renamed without syncing the directory, so a crash
seconds later could lose the rename — on the one file whose loss cannot be
undone.

### What was checked and found sound

Envelope encryption: per-secret data keys, AES-256-GCM both levels, the wrapped
key bound to its key id and the ciphertext bound to where it is stored, a strict
base64 decoder so an envelope has exactly one textual form, and bounds checked
before every slice. Passwords: Argon2id at the OWASP parameters, parameters read
back from the hash so old ones keep working, an unknown account costing the same
hash as a known one, and a lockout per account and per address. Sessions and API
tokens: SHA-256 at rest, expiry checked after the read, a disabled account cut
off immediately rather than at expiry. CSRF: double-submit, enforced only where a
cookie could carry the request, exempt for bearer tokens. The store: one
interpolated statement, and its table and column names come from a fixed list.
The API's authorization is gated by tests that walk the router rather than a
list somebody maintains — every route refuses an anonymous request, every route
that takes an id refuses another team's.

## Phase 50 — the schedules, the sweep, and six documents that were wrong

An audit of the builder, the deploy path, the cluster adapter and cron, and a
read of every document against the code.

### The settings that had nowhere to be set

Single sign-on is built — OIDC, PKCE, a verified ID token, a nonce, a spent
state. Six settings, a section of the documentation, and **no way to set them in
the panel**: the frontend kept its own list of setting groups, and `signin` was
not in it, so the group rendered as nothing at all. Plugins had been the same
thing a commit earlier.

The list is now an *ordering*, not the list. The groups come from the settings
the server sends; anything this build has not heard of is shown at the end under
its own key. Untranslated is worse than translated and a great deal better than
invisible, and a hand-kept copy of somebody else's list is a list that is wrong
the day it changes.

### A backup schedule nothing could parse

`PUT /api/databases/{id}/backup-policy` verified that backup storage worked —
"rather than at three in the morning", as the comment says — and did not verify
the schedule. Anything at all was accepted, stored, and then never matched, so
the backups simply did not happen. Nothing could report it: by then it is a row
that is never due. It is parsed now, and refused with the same message the
scheduled-command path uses.

### "5/15" meant five

In cron, a step after a plain number means "from here to the end of the field,
every n". The parser cut the step off, parsed the number, and dropped the step on
the floor — so `0 5/6 * * *`, four times a day, ran once. The schedule parsed.
Nothing was logged. It is the exact failure the package comment says it exists to
prevent, written in the package itself.

`Describe` is gone rather than fixed. It rendered a schedule in words and would
say "every day at 03:00 UTC" for `0 3 * 1 *`, which runs in January — and it had
no callers, because a sentence built in Go cannot be shown in an interface where
every string is a translation key.

### The minute tick that could stop for half an hour

Scheduled backups run on the panel's own minute tick. The registry sweep ran
inside that tick: it takes the build lock, which waits for every build in flight
— a build is allowed forty minutes — and then waits up to thirty more for its
Job. For that whole window no backup was evaluated, and a nightly backup due
inside it never ran. Maintenance now runs beside the tick rather than in it.

Ticks are dropped by Go when the receiver is late, so the tick also catches up:
it evaluates every minute since the last one it looked at, capped at five —
Kubernetes' own starting deadline for a CronJob that could not start on time.
Long enough for a slow minute or a restart, short enough that a panel switched on
after a week off does not fire a week of backups at once. A policy that matches
several caught-up minutes still runs once.

### Applying onto a corpse

`Delete` returns when the API server accepts the request. With foreground
propagation the object stays — deletion timestamp, finalizer — until its
dependents are collected. Two places deleted a Job and applied the same name
immediately: the build, and the registry sweep, whose Job has the same name every
single time. The apply is accepted, the object is collected a moment later, and
the wait that follows waits for something that is not coming: a build that never
starts, or a sweep that reports it did not finish while the disk fills. There is
a `DeleteAndWait` now, with a test that an object held by a finalizer produces a
refusal rather than an apply.

### What the documents claimed

* `CLAUDE.md`'s package layout was missing fourteen packages — plugins, the
  firewall, cron, the registry client, the three guard packages — and listed a
  doc-site directory under the frontend that does not exist. The doc site is
  `internal/docsite`, and the check in it caught this paragraph naming the path
  that is gone, which is the check working.
* `docs/configuration.md` described a **Git** settings group that is empty: the
  GitHub App settings were removed when it turned out nothing read them, and the
  table still offered them. It was missing **Cluster**, **Sign-in** (six
  settings, already documented in the same file) and **Plugins**, and described
  Domains without the tunnel token, the trusted proxies or the geo databases.
* `docs/backups.md` said a volume backup could be put on a schedule "the same way
  as for a database". There is no volume policy: no route, no handler, no
  control. Databases have schedules; volumes are taken when somebody asks.
* `llms.txt` — the page the product hands an AI assistant — had no firewall and
  no plugins in it at all, in either the endpoint list or the notes.
* `docs/progress.md` said `docs/decisions.md` holds ADR-0001 to ADR-0017. It
  holds nineteen.

### What was checked and found sound

The deploy path handles the things that usually go wrong: a deployment
interrupted by a restart is marked failed at startup rather than left "building"
forever, a superseded build is stopped rather than left to roll out an older
version behind a newer one, a panic in one deployment is caught without taking
the panel with it, the fingerprint match only ever reuses an image from a
deployment that succeeded, and a rollback outside the registry's keep window is
refused with a reason instead of sitting in ImagePullBackOff. Scheduled commands
are Kubernetes CronJobs and not the panel's business: "a panel that is restarting
at 03:00 should not be the reason a nightly job did not run."

## Phase 49 — the settings nobody could open, and a domain nobody owned

Two settings and a rename.

**The plugin settings had nowhere to be set.** The panel defined them, the
documentation told people to open Settings, then Plugins — and the frontend's
group list did not carry `plugins`, so the group rendered as nothing at all. A
setting that exists on the server and not on the page is a setting that only
looks configurable.

They have a tab now, with a button that reads the catalogue and says which of
the three answers came back: signed by the key set here, readable and vouched
for by nobody, or a failure that names itself. An address and a key are a pair
you otherwise discover is wrong on the day you wanted a plugin. It reads on
request rather than on mount, because an address somebody is halfway through
typing should not be fetched and a store that is down should not make the
settings page look broken.

**`skifity.io` was never ours.** `skifity.com` is. It was the vendor domain on
every Kubernetes label and annotation the panel writes — `skifity.io/app-id`,
`skifity.io/managed` — the plugin standard's `apiVersion`, and the install
command in the README, the installer, the release notes and every page of the
documentation. Using a domain somebody else may register is the one thing the
Kubernetes convention for those keys exists to prevent, and doing it before
anything is published costs nothing where doing it after costs everybody a
migration.

The rename found a latent bug. `internal/provision/scripts.go` wrote
`--node-label=skifity.io/managed=true` by hand while everything else went
through `version.LabelKey`, so changing the domain in the one file that is
documented as the place to change it would have left every node carrying a key
nothing else looked for. It goes through the same function now.

## Phase 48 — the store, and the page that admits what it cannot reach

The runtime could install a plugin. Nothing could find one.

**A store is two static files.** `index.json` lists what is available;
`index.json.sig` is a detached Ed25519 signature over its exact bytes. Two files
rather than one envelope, because a catalogue somebody can open in a browser and
check by eye is worth more than one that is only machine-readable. No database,
no API, no accounts — a store is a directory on a web server.

**The signature is checked before the index is parsed.** Parsing first would
mean the panel had already acted on bytes nobody vouched for. An index entry
pins its manifest by SHA-256, so the operator vouches for the list and the hash
stops a manifest being swapped after the list was signed. That is an apt release
file, and it is chosen because it needs no key registry: a publisher does not
need a key, because the store is what vouches for them.

Three answers, not two, for the key:

* **No key configured** — the index is read and every entry is marked as
  unverified, on the page, in those words. Refusing outright would mean a store
  cannot be used until somebody pastes a key.
* **A key, and a signature that checks out** — verified.
* **A key, and no signature or a wrong one** — an error, not a catalogue. The
  quiet middle answer is what turns a signature into decoration.

**One bad row must not empty the page.** An entry with no id, no manifest
address or an unparseable hash is dropped, because it is not a thing the panel
could install even if it wanted to; the rest of the catalogue still shows. An
index of another version is refused whole, because that is not a bad row, it is
a file this build cannot read.

`skifity admin plugin-key` prints a pair and writes neither. A command that
saved the private key for you is a command that leaves a signing key in `/root`,
and the one thing an operator has to do with it is put it somewhere they already
trust. `skifity admin plugin-sign` signs a file's exact bytes — reformat the
JSON afterwards and the signature stops matching, which is the point. Signing
and verifying live in the same package, because two implementations of "the
exact bytes" is one implementation and one bug waiting.

**The Plugins page is three tabs**: what is installed, the store, and an
address. The third is not a fallback for when the store is down — a cluster
behind a proxy that never reaches `plugins.skifity.com` has to be able to run
plugins too, and so does an operator who wants their own index and their own
key. Both are settings.

Installing from the store is still the runtime's two requests: the manifest is
fetched, its permissions are shown, and the install is refused if they changed
between the screen and the button. The store adds a hash check in front of that
and nothing else — being in a signed index is not a reason to skip the part that
actually protects anybody.

**Verified by running it:** a key generated by the real binary signs a real file,
`pluginstore.VerifySignature` accepts it, and rejects it after one byte changes.
Nine unit tests cover the rest: another key's signature, a tampered index, a
missing signature where a key is configured, the unsigned path, a manifest that
does not match its hash, a wrong index version, and the bad rows that get
dropped.

**Not run:** nothing is published at `plugins.skifity.com`. The panel can read a
store, verify one and install from one; there is no store. The Store tab will
say it could not reach anything, which is the truth.

## Phase 47 — the plugin runtime

The standard said what a plugin is. This runs one.

Installing is four things in an order that matters: a token narrowed to exactly
the permissions the manifest declared, a secret the plugin will verify events
with, a Secret object holding both plus its settings, then the pod. The token
first, because a pod that starts without one is a plugin whose first request
fails for a reason nobody can see. Removing is the same list backwards, and the
token goes even when the cluster cannot be reached — a credential nobody can
trace to anything is worse than a namespace left behind.

**One namespace per plugin**, not one shared namespace with all of them in it.
Two plugins from two publishers have no more reason to reach each other than two
tenants do. What a plugin can reach is the panel, DNS and the internet; what it
cannot is every other namespace, the node network and the cloud metadata
address. It holds no Kubernetes token, runs non-root on a read-only root
filesystem, and its namespace enforces the strict profile — a requirement a
plugin author can meet, because unlike an off-the-shelf application image they
control the Dockerfile.

**Installing is two requests, deliberately.** The first reads a manifest and
answers what it would do; the second installs it, and is refused when the
permissions no longer match what was shown. One request would mean the
permissions were displayed by the same call that granted them, which is a
confirmation nobody reads because it is already too late. Owner-only: an admin
who manages servers is not the same person as the one who decides what code runs
in the cluster.

**Every event carries an HMAC** over its exact bytes, keyed per plugin. The
endpoint is only reachable from the panel's namespace, which is the first line
and not the only one — anything that ever runs beside the panel could otherwise
post "deploy.before, allow it" and be believed.

The four rules about blocking each have a test, because each is a way for the
hook to be decoration:

* **Silence is not consent.** An empty body is a refusal; a plugin that answered
  200 and nothing else has said nothing.
* **Not answering is not a refusal.** A plugin that stops every deploy the
  moment it is upgraded is a plugin nobody installs twice.
* **Every blocking plugin has to agree.** One plugin's yes does not overrule
  another's no.
* **It is capped at ten seconds**, whatever the manifest asked for, because the
  thing on the other end is a person watching a page.

Delivery is not guaranteed and does not pretend to be: an event is posted once,
with a short timeout, and a plugin that must not miss anything reads the state
back through the API. A retry loop that looked like a guarantee and was not one
would be worse.

Still missing: the store, and the interface. A plugin is installed over the API
by pasting a manifest or giving its address.

## Phase 46 — the plugin standard, and the permission model it needed first

The ask was an ecosystem: other people writing features for Skifity, including
commercial ones, published to a store and installed from the panel. What that
needs before it needs a store is a **standard**, because the standard is the one
thing everybody else builds against and the one thing that cannot be changed
casually afterwards.

**The permission model had to come first, and it was not one.** API token scopes
were `read` and `write`, decided by the HTTP method — so a plugin that copies
backups and a plugin that provisions servers would carry the same token, and
installing the first would grant the second's powers. "This plugin may only read
your apps" would have been a sentence on a screen that nothing enforced. Scopes
now name a resource as well as a direction, `apps:read`, `backups:write`, over
twelve resources, checked in the one middleware rather than per handler — a scope
enforced per handler stops being enforced the day somebody adds a route and does
not think about it. A path no scope covers is refused to a scoped token rather
than falling into whichever scope was nearest, and the older unscoped forms keep
meaning exactly what they meant.

**The standard is `internal/plugins`, not prose.** A manifest that parses and
validates there is a valid plugin, and the example in `docs/plugins.md` is a
test: if it stops being valid, the standard changed and it was not on purpose.
See ADR-0018 for why a container rather than a library, with `plugin.Open`'s own
documentation quoted for why that door is closed.

Three rules in it are the ones somebody will try to relax:

* **The image is a digest, never a tag.** A tag can be moved by whoever controls
  the registry, and this image is about to be handed an API token.
* **`read` and `write` alone are refused for a plugin.** They mean every
  resource, which nobody can meaningfully agree to on a screen.
* **Only an event that happens before something may block**, capped at ten
  seconds, because the thing on the other end is a person watching a page.

And one trap avoided by writing the test: the subscription field is `event:` and
not `on:`. `on` is a boolean in YAML 1.1, so `on: backup.completed` parses in
some readers as the key `true` — the scar GitHub Actions carries in every
workflow file ever written. A standard being defined today should not step on
it, and the only reason this was caught is that the example manifest is
exercised rather than admired.

Nothing installs a plugin yet, and `docs/plugins.md` says so in the same words:
the runtime, the event delivery and the store are not written. What exists is
what a plugin *is*, so that one can be written against it.

## Phase 45 — an allowlist, and everything it took to make one real

Asked whether there was an allowlist by address, by network or by country.
There was none of any kind: `netguard` is outbound SSRF protection and
unrelated. So this is one, in the shape people already know from Cloudflare —
an ordered list of rules over the request, combined with and and or.

The expression is a tree rather than a string. Cloudflare writes theirs as a
small language and then has to parse it; the panel does not need one, because
the interface builds the tree directly and "match all of these" and "match any
of these" are groups on a form, not syntax anybody has to learn.

**Unknown is a third answer.** A rule about a country is worthless if nothing
knows the country, and both ways of pretending otherwise are wrong: as false a
Block rule silently stops blocking, as true an Allow rule silently blocks
everybody. So it is neither, and it propagates the way it does in SQL. A rule
that comes out unknown is skipped by name rather than deciding.

**The geo data needs no account.** DB-IP publish country and network databases
monthly under CC BY 4.0 with no sign-up, where GeoLite2 wants a registered
account before a single byte — a registration in the middle of turning on a
firewall rule. The decode tags were checked against the real files rather than
the documentation: 1.1.1.1 is AU and AS13335, 8.8.8.8 is US and AS15169.
Attribution is on the page and in `docs/firewall.md`.

**The guard is its own process, not the panel.** Traefik can ask an external
service whether to let a request through, and the panel is the obvious place and
the wrong one: its Deployment uses Recreate, because its database is a file on
one node's disk, so every panel upgrade would take every protected site down. It
is the same binary in another mode, with no database, no Kubernetes API access
and no credentials — its whole state is a ConfigMap the kubelet drops into its
filesystem.

**Three knobs were removed for being lies**, each caught by writing the test:

* a per-rule-set *fail open*, whose value lived inside the file the guard had
  failed to read, and which Traefik decides before this process is reached;
* `authRequestHeaders` on the middleware, a list of headers to forward, which
  would have made a rule on any header not in the list match nothing — the rule
  saved, the request allowed, the header never sent to the process judging it;
* "is a geo database available", inferred from whether a URL setting was empty
  — and empty means the default, so it was always available and the check meant
  nothing. It is an explicit switch now, on by default.

**And the file the whole feature is worth exactly as much as** is the one that
decides who is asking. `X-Forwarded-For` is walked from the right and stops at
the first entry that did not come from a proxy we trust, because only the
rightmost entry was added by somebody we know. Trust is a list of ranges rather
than a hop count, since a hop count is wrong the moment somebody adds a load
balancer and the failure is silent. Junk in the chain stops the walk rather than
being skipped. Cloudflare's headers are believed only when the peer handing them
over is one of ours — which also makes the country free behind the tunnel, with
no database consulted at all.

## Phase 44 — two things wanting the same name

Asked whether collisions, SSH and the shell were sound. SSH and the shell were.
Naming was not, in two places, and one of them was a way in.

**Two apps called "web" and only one address.** Every app is given an automatic
address worked out from its slug and its environment — and from nothing else. So
two projects each with an app called "web" in Production both wanted
`web.apps.example.com`. The hostname column is unique, so the second insert was
refused, and the deployer swallowed that as a log warning: the second app had no
address at all, and the page showed nothing explaining why. "web", "api" and
"app" are what people call things, so this was not a corner case but the second
project. Proved with a test before it was fixed.

The address is now chosen by asking who holds the readable name. Free, or this
app's own, and it keeps it; somebody else's, and it gets the same name with a
short suffix derived from the app's id. Derived, not random, because it must be
the same on every deploy. And an app that took the longer name keeps it when the
sibling holding the short one is deleted — otherwise a URL would move under the
user on an unrelated deploy. When there is genuinely no address to be had, the
deployment log says so, because a person looking at an app with no URL has no
reason to read the panel's own log and no way to reach it.

**An app could claim the panel's own hostname.** Nothing checked. Two Ingresses
with the same host in different namespaces is not an error Kubernetes reports:
the ingress controller picks one, and which one survives a restart is not
something anybody decided. A member of any team could point an app at the
panel's address and start receiving the requests a browser sends it, sign-in
cookie included. It is refused now, against both places the panel learns its own
address — the installer's environment variable and the Settings value — in every
shape somebody might type it. A subdomain of it is still somebody's own business
and still works.

**The confinement fix had not reached the run Job.** Phase 43 changed the
Deployment and not `BuildRunJob`, which `BuildCronJob` also renders from. So on
an environment lowered to run an image that starts as root, the app ran and a
migration in that same image was refused: a panel saying "your app runs, and you
cannot run anything in it". It uses the app's own confinement now.

**The port scan could not see a UDP socket.** The preflight checked 80, 443,
6443, 10250, 2379 and 2380 with `ss -lnt`, which lists TCP — and every port the
pod network uses is UDP. A VPS running a WireGuard VPN of its own holds exactly
the port flannel's wireguard-native backend wants, and the failure is a cluster
that comes up with every node Ready and no traffic between pods, which looks
like anything except a port conflict. 8472, 51820 and 51821 are checked now:
fatal for the backend this cluster actually uses, with the fix naming the other
one, and a note rather than a refusal for the backend it does not.

What was read and found sound: the SSH client (modern host key algorithms only,
trust on first use with the fingerprint stored and a later change refused rather
than warned about, a handshake deadline of its own, files written through a
quoted heredoc with a delimiter collision check), `shellsafe` and its use at
every interpolation in the generated scripts, `runsafe`, and the run Job's own
isolation — no service account token, no retries, its own labels so a migration
pod is never counted as an app instance.

## Phase 43 — the catalogue that could not start

The question was whether autoscaling, deploying and database replicas were
sound. Two of the three had defects, and one of them was the largest thing found
in this repository.

**Every app's pod was pinned to uid 1000.** `BuildDeployment` wrote
`runAsUser: 1000`, `runAsNonRoot: true` and `drop: ALL` into every pod spec,
including every one-click template, in namespaces enforcing the `restricted`
Pod Security profile. That is exactly right for an app Skifity builds — Railpack
and Nixpacks both produce a process running as 1000 — and it is a guess for
anybody else's image.

It was measured rather than assumed. Of the catalogue's 295 unique images, 124
had their config blob read straight from their registries before Docker Hub's
rate limit ended the run: **120 of the 124 do not run as uid 1000**, and 87 of
those declare no non-root user at all, which `restricted` refuses outright.
Separately, **51 of the catalogue's 334 services listen on a port below 1024** —
WordPress, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, GitLab, MediaWiki, phpMyAdmin — and with
every capability dropped, no `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, and containerd leaving
`net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` at the kernel default of 1024 where Docker
sets it to 0, not one of them could bind its port. The product's front page was
a catalogue that mostly could not start, and nothing anywhere said so.

The fix is three parts.

**The uid is pinned only for an image Skifity built.** For anybody else's, the
`USER` the image declares is the right answer, and leaving the field unset is
how you say that.

**A low port gets one safe sysctl.** `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start: "0"`
is narrower than handing back `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`: it lets this pod's
processes bind a low port in this pod's own network namespace and grants no
capability to anything. Kubernetes has called it safe since 1.22 — namespaced,
unable to affect another pod or the node — so no kubelet configuration is needed,
and it is on the list both the baseline and the restricted profile allow.

**The confinement level belongs to the environment**, defaulting to the strict
one, changed by an admin under the project. At the lower level a third-party
image may start as root and keeps the runtime's default capability set, because
an image that drops to its own user calls setuid and needs `CAP_SETUID` and
`CAP_SETGID` — dropping ALL from a root container breaks the very images the
level exists to run. Everything else stays refused at both levels: privileged
containers, host namespaces, host paths, capabilities beyond the runtime's set,
and gaining privileges the process did not start with. An app Skifity built is
held to the strict rules at either level. And a lowered namespace still carries
`audit` and `warn` at `restricted`, so lowering the bar does not also turn off
the measurement.

The kubelet's own words for the failure are `container has runAsNonRoot and
image will run as root`, which reads like a fault in the image. It is not, and
the panel now replaces it with the sentence that names the switch.

## Phase 42 — the front door, built

## The repository itself

`CONTRIBUTING.md` and a pull request template, which a repository this size
should have had from the start, and the README's documentation table now lists
all ten pages the panel serves rather than eight.

## Next tasks

1. Run the installer end to end on a real Ubuntu server and measure idle memory.
   Both need hardware this sandbox cannot provide.
2. Tag a release, which publishes the binaries and the image the installer
   points at.
3. Deploy a real application from Git, end to end, on that server — the one
   flow that has never been exercised against a live cluster.
4. Translate the error catalogue. Every `errdoc.Problem` — title, cause, impact
   and fix — is English in all five languages. The settings page was the same
   until Phase 55 and the mechanism it uses works here too: a key per error
   code, with the server's English as the fallback.
5. A schedule for a volume backup. The scheduler already runs a policy whose
   target is a volume; there is no route, no handler and no control, and
   `docs/backups.md` now says so rather than implying otherwise.
6. Publish a plugin store at `plugins.skifity.com`: an `index.json`, its
   signature, and the public key in the documentation. The panel reads one
   already; nothing is there to read.

## Open issues

* **Nothing has ever run against a real cluster.** `test/smoke` holds exactly
  two scripts — the panel and the installer — and neither touches Kubernetes.
  This entry used to say the cluster smoke tests "exist and are reviewed, not
  executed", and `panel.sh` used to name four of them in its header. They were
  never written. Everything that talks to a cluster — `internal/cluster`,
  `internal/deploy`, `internal/dbsvc`, `internal/backup`, the parts of
  `internal/kube` beyond manifest generation — is checked against the objects it
  renders and against a fake clientset, never against an API server. That is the
  largest single gap in this repository, it is a consequence of ADR-0010, and
  writing scripts that could not be run here would have widened it rather than
  closed it.
* **None of the published install path exists.** `get.skifity.com` does not
  resolve. There is no `skifity/skifity` repository on GitHub — this one is
  `TegarTheGreat/Skifity` — so the installer's manifest fetch
  (`raw.githubusercontent.com/skifity/skifity/main/deploy`) and its CLI download
  (`github.com/skifity/skifity/releases`) both point at nothing, and
  `ghcr.io/skifity/skifity` has never been pushed. This entry used to admit only
  the image. The working path is to clone the repository, `make image`, and run
  `installer/install.sh` from inside the clone with `SKIFITY_IMAGE` set, which
  makes it read `deploy/*.yaml` from disk; the README, `llms.txt` and the quick
  start now say so where the one-line command is.
* **No plugin has ever actually run.** The manifest standard, the permission
  model, the rendered Kubernetes objects, the event delivery and the blocking
  verdicts are unit-tested. Whether a real plugin image starts in the namespace
  this renders, and whether an event reaches it over a real cluster network, has
  not been tried — ADR-0010 again. There is no store and no interface: a plugin
  is installed over the API.
* **The firewall has never been through a live Traefik.** The rules engine, the
  address handling, the geo lookup, the guard's decisions and the rendered
  Kubernetes objects are unit-tested, and the country and network lookups were
  checked against the real DB-IP databases. Whether Traefik loads the middleware
  and forwards what the guard reads needs a cluster, which is ADR-0010 again.
* **The confinement levels have never been enforced by a real API server.**
  The rendered pod specs, the namespace labels and the rules that choose between
  them are unit-tested; whether the kubelet accepts the sysctl and whether a
  root image then starts needs a cluster, which is the same gap as everything
  else in ADR-0010.
* **The Cloudflare tunnel has never reached Cloudflare.** The manifests, the
  refusal without a token, the validator and the rollover on a changed token are
  unit-tested; connecting requires a real Cloudflare account, which this sandbox
  does not have. It is the same gap as everything else in ADR-0010, and it is
  named in `docs/adding-servers.md` where the instructions are.
* The interface test needs a Chromium. It uses one already on the machine when
  `CHROMIUM_PATH` is set, and CI installs its own.
* k3s's memory footprint is not measured; the panel's is, in
  `docs/performance.md`.
* There is no shell into a running instance, and this is a decision rather than
  a gap. A one-off command runs in the app's own image with the app's own
  variables, can be watched, leaves a log, and works when the app will not
  start — which is when people reach for a shell. See `docs/roadmap.md`.
* A volume backup is a tar taken while the app runs, not a snapshot, so a file
  being written at that moment can be caught half-written. `docs/backups.md`
  says so and says what to do instead.
* The nixpacks builder is written and unit-tested and has never been run: like
  everything else that needs a cluster, it is checked against the rendered Job
  and not against a build. Railpack is the default and the one the product is
  designed around.
* The frontend is 509 kB of the panel's own code, 145 kB compressed, beside
  vendor chunks a browser keeps across upgrades. Served from the binary on the
  same host, so it is not the problem it would be over a CDN.

## Idle resource usage

`docs/performance.md`. The panel is measured: 34 MiB resident idle, 38 MiB after
400 requests, 39 MiB of binary. k3s's own footprint is not measured here, for
the same reason as everything else that needs a cluster.
