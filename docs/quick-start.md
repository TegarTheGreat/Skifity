# Quick start

From an empty server to an app on the internet. Most of it is waiting for things
to download, and how long that takes has never been measured on real hardware —
when it has, the number goes here.

## What you need

* A server running Ubuntu 24.04 or Debian 12, with at least 1 GB of memory and
  8 GB of free disk, and root access over SSH. Any VPS will do.
* Optionally, a domain name. Skifity works without one.

### Which systems

**The servers.** Skifity installs k3s as a systemd unit and manages it with
`systemctl`, so systemd is the one hard requirement.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tested** | Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12 |
| **Expected to work, not tested** | AlmaLinux, Rocky, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, SLES, Arch |
| **Will not work** | Alpine, or anything else on OpenRC — no systemd. An unprivileged LXC or a Docker container, for the same reason. |
| **Architectures** | x86-64 and arm64. Nothing else, and the preflight says so before it changes anything. |

Adding a server checks all of this before touching the machine, and says which
requirement was not met rather than failing partway through an install.

Two things worth knowing before you pick a server:

* **The firewall is configured for you**, whichever one the distribution ships:
  ufw on Ubuntu and Debian, firewalld on the Red Hat family, plain iptables when
  neither is running. The cluster ports are opened to the other servers only —
  never to the internet — and the pod and service networks are trusted
  wholesale, because traffic between pods is not on a fixed port.
* **A Raspberry Pi needs one line changed first.** Raspberry Pi OS ships with
  the memory cgroup switched off and the kubelet cannot start without it. Add
  `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory` to the end of the single line in
  `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` and reboot. The preflight checks this and says so
  rather than letting k3s fail with a message about cgroups.

**Your own machine**, for the `skifity` CLI and the MCP server — which are the
same binary as the panel:

| | |
|---|---|
| Linux | x86-64, arm64 |
| macOS | Intel, Apple Silicon |
| Windows | x86-64, arm64 |

The CLI needs nothing installed: one static file, no libc, no runtime. The panel
half of that binary is only meant to run on Linux, because what it installs is
Linux.

**Anyone using the panel** needs a browser. It is a web page.

## 1. Install

> **Not published yet.** No release has been tagged, so there is no version to
> put in the URL below and nothing at `ghcr.io/tegarthegreat/skifity` to pull.
> The installer knows this and refuses before it changes anything. To try it
> today, clone the repository and run the installer from inside it, which reads
> the manifests from disk instead of fetching them:
>
> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/TegarTheGreat/Skifity && cd Skifity
> make image                        # prints the tag it built
> sudo SKIFITY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/tegarthegreat/skifity:$(git describe --tags --always --dirty) \
>   sh installer/install.sh
> ```
>
> The image tag is local; nothing is pushed anywhere. Running the installer from
> inside the clone is what makes it read `deploy/*.yaml` from disk rather than
> fetching them from a release that does not exist.
>
> Do that on a VPS you can throw away. See the Status section of the README.

SSH into the server and run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TegarTheGreat/Skifity/<version>/installer/install.sh | sudo sh
```

`<version>` is the release you are installing, `v1.2.3`. It is in the URL on
purpose: the installer fetched from a tag applies the Kubernetes objects that
tag's image was built with, so an upgrade never mixes one release's image with
another's Deployment.

If you already have a domain pointed at the server, tell the installer and it
sets up HTTPS at the same time:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TegarTheGreat/Skifity/<version>/installer/install.sh \
  | sudo SKIFITY_DOMAIN=panel.example.com sh
```

It checks the server first, installs Kubernetes, starts the panel, and finishes
by printing a link. The link already has the setup token in it, so opening it is
the whole of the next step — no copying a forty-character string across. The
token is in the `#fragment`, which browsers never send to a server, and the page
takes it out of the address bar as soon as it has read it. The plain URL and the
token are printed underneath as well, for when the link is easier to retype than
to click.

It also puts `skifity`, the command line tool, on the server's PATH — served by
the panel it has just started, so it is always the matching version and needs no
internet at all.

If it stops, it says what happened and what to do about it. The full log is at
`/var/log/skifity-install.log`, and running the installer again is safe.

## 2. Create your account

![The setup screen, asking for the token and the first account](images/setup.png)

Open the link. The token is already filled in; choose an email address and a
password, and name your team.

![The recovery key screen, which cannot be passed without acknowledging it](images/recovery-key.png)

You are then shown a **recovery key**. It is the only copy: it can decrypt every
secret Skifity stores, and without it a restored backup is unreadable. Download
it and put it somewhere that is not this server. The panel will keep reminding
you until you say you have.

## 3. Deploy something

The overview has a **New app** button. Press it, paste a Git repository URL, and
press Create.

That is the whole form. Skifity works out how to build it, gives it a URL, and
sets `PORT` for it to listen on. The deployment page shows the build as it
happens.

When it finishes, the app has a working address. Press it.

**No repository?** If the app is a folder on your computer — which it is, when
an assistant wrote it — [get the CLI](/docs/cli#getting-it) and run this in the
folder:

```sh
skifity login
skifity up
```

It does what the form does, from the folder: works out what the app is, creates
it with the database it uses, sends the code without your `.env`, and prints the
address. See [the CLI](/docs/cli#deploying-a-folder).

That first address looks like `web.203-0-113-10.sslip.io`, and it is **plain
HTTP, on purpose**. sslip.io resolves any name under it to the IP in the name,
so there is no DNS to set up — but every Skifity install in the world shares
that one domain's certificate rate limit, and a free address that stops working
because somebody else installed Skifity this morning is worse than one that was
never encrypted (ADR-0015). HTTPS is the next step, and it is automatic once the
domain is yours.

> The button is there because setup already made you a project called **First
> project** with a **Production** environment in it, and because the server you
> installed on is already listed under **Servers** — it is the cluster's first
> node, and Skifity records it during setup rather than asking you to add a
> machine you are already looking at. `⌘K` has the same **New app** action from
> anywhere.

## 4. Add your own domain

Open the app, go to **Domains**, and add yours. The panel shows the DNS record
to create. Once it resolves, the certificate is issued automatically and the
domain goes green. This is where HTTPS comes from: a domain you control has its
own rate limit, so cert-manager can ask for a certificate and keep renewing it.

Your app keeps its original address too, so nothing breaks while DNS
propagates.

## 5. Add a second server

One server is fine to start — you already have one, the machine you installed
on. When you want more capacity, or you want the cluster to survive a failure,
go to **Servers** and press **Add a server**.

Enter its IP address and how to sign in. Skifity does the rest: it checks the
server, installs a key of its own, configures the firewall, joins the server to
the cluster, and starts placing instances on it. The password you type is used
once and never stored.

Three control plane servers is the point at which losing one changes nothing.
