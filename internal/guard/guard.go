// Package guard is the process that actually stops a request.
//
// # Why this is not the panel
//
// Traefik can ask an external service whether to let a request through, which
// is how Authelia and oauth2-proxy attach to it, and the obvious place to put
// that service is the panel: it holds the rules already. It is the wrong place.
// The panel's own Deployment uses the Recreate strategy, because its database
// is a file on one node's disk — so every upgrade stops the panel, and every
// protected app would stop with it. A firewall that takes the sites down when
// the panel is upgraded is a firewall people turn off.
//
// So the guard is its own Deployment, with two replicas spread across servers,
// and it is the same binary: `skifity edge-guard`. It has no database, no
// Kubernetes API access and no credentials. Its whole state is a file the panel
// writes into a ConfigMap and the kubelet drops into its filesystem.
//
// # Failing
//
// Traefik has no way to ignore an authorizer that does not answer: an
// unreachable one is a 500 and the request does not reach the app. So a guard
// that is entirely down takes the protected sites down with it, and there is no
// per-site knob that could change that — the decision is Traefik's, before this
// process is reached. An earlier draft of this file had one, which would have
// been a switch in the panel that controlled nothing.
//
// What can be done is done: two replicas spread across servers, and a readiness
// probe that reports a replica with no rules loaded as not ready, so a rollout
// never puts one in front of traffic it cannot judge. And the guard never fails
// open for a reason it could have avoided — a rules file it cannot parse leaves
// the previous one in place rather than becoming an empty rule set that allows
// everybody.
