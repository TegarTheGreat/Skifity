// One-off commands.
//
// Every product like this needs a way to run something once, in the app's own
// image, with the app's own variables: a database migration, a management
// command, a look around. Without it a migration has nowhere to run, and the
// answer people reach for is a shell on the server and kubectl — which is the
// thing the panel exists to avoid.
//
// A run is a Kubernetes Job, not an exec into a running pod. An exec needs a
// pod that is already up, which is exactly what a failed migration prevents,
// and it competes for the CPU and memory the app is serving with. A Job runs
// on its own, can be watched, and leaves a log.
