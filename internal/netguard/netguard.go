// Package netguard stops the panel being used to reach addresses it should
// never reach on somebody else's behalf.
//
// Two settings hold an address the panel then makes a request to: a Git
// connection's base URL, and a notification channel's webhook. Both are written
// by a team administrator, which on a single-tenant install is the operator
// themselves and no boundary at all — and on an install with more than one team
// is somebody who should not be able to point the panel's own process at
// 169.254.169.254 and read what comes back. The panel holds the master key and
// can reach the Kubernetes API; it is the last process on the box that should
// make arbitrary requests.
//
// What is refused is deliberately narrow:
//
//   - the cloud metadata service, on the link-local range, which hands out the
//     provider credentials for the whole machine to anything that asks;
//   - loopback, which is the panel itself and whatever else shares its network;
//   - the unspecified address and multicast, which are not somewhere a Git host
//     or a webhook receiver lives.
//
// What is allowed, on purpose, is every private range. A self-hosted Gitea on
// 10.0.0.5 and a webhook receiver on the same LAN are exactly what this product
// is for, and refusing them to say something about security would break the
// ordinary case to defend against the administrator who configured it.
//
// The check runs on the resolved address immediately before the connection is
// made, rather than on the hostname. A name that resolves to a public address
// when it is validated and a link-local one when it is dialled is the oldest
// way around a check written the other way round.
