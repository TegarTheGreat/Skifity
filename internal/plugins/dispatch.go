// Sending a plugin what happened.
//
// # Why a signature
//
// A plugin's endpoint is reachable from the panel's namespace and nowhere else,
// which is the first line. It is not the only one: anything that ever ends up
// running beside the panel could otherwise post "deploy.before, allow it" to a
// plugin and be believed. So every event carries an HMAC over its exact bytes,
// keyed with a secret the panel generated for that plugin alone and put in the
// same Secret as its token. A plugin that does not check it is a plugin that
// trusts its network, and the documentation says to check it.
//
// # Why delivery is not guaranteed
//
// It is not a queue and does not pretend to be. An event is posted once, with a
// short timeout; a plugin that was restarting misses it. Saying so plainly is
// better than a retry loop that looks like a guarantee and is not one — a
// plugin that must not miss anything reads the state back through the API,
// which is what its token is for.
//
// The exception is the blocking kind, which is not a notification at all but a
// question the panel is waiting on.

// SignatureHeader carries the HMAC a plugin verifies.
const SignatureHeader = "X-Skifity-Signature"

// EventHeader names the event, so a plugin can route without parsing the body.
const EventHeader = "X-Skifity-Event"

// EventPath is where a plugin receives events.
const EventPath = "/events"

// Event is what a plugin is sent.
type Event struct {
	// Event is the name, such as "deploy.succeeded".
	Event string `json:"event"`
	// At is when it happened, so a plugin can tell a replay from news.
	At time.Time `json:"at"`
	// Data is the payload, which differs per event and is documented per event.
	Data any `json:"data"`
}

// Verdict is what a blocking hook answers.
//
// The zero value refuses, and that is on purpose: a plugin that answers 200
// with an empty body has said nothing, and treating silence as consent is how a
// blocking hook becomes decoration.
type Verdict struct {
	Allow bool `json:"allow"`
	// Reason is shown to the person whose deploy was stopped. Without one they
	// are told a plugin refused and nothing else, which is a support ticket.
	Reason string `json:"reason,omitempty"`
}

// Target is one plugin an event goes to.
type Target struct {
	// ID is the plugin's identifier, for the log and for the refusal message.
	ID string
	// Name is what it calls itself, which is what a person should be told.
	Name string
	// URL is its in-cluster address, without the path.

	// It takes the team the event belongs to as well as the event's name. A
	// plugin is installed panel-wide but hears only about the teams whoever
	// installed it can already see: without that, an owner of one team installs
	// a plugin and it is told about every other team's deploys, and can refuse
	// them.

	// Call. Separate from Targets because it is a different question with a
	// different answer shape: an event goes to everybody who subscribed, and a
	// call goes to exactly the plugin whose vendor was chosen. It returns
	// ErrNoProvider when nothing installed provides it, which is an ordinary
	// state rather than a failure.
	//
	// There is no team argument. A provider is configured by an administrator
	// against a named plugin, so the choice has already been made by somebody
