# test/cluster/verify.sh installs k3s and changes the machine it runs on, which
# is why nobody runs it: it needs a throwaway server, a way to get an image onto
# that server, and the repository beside it. This does those three things and
# then runs it.

# What it does, in order: builds the panel image for the server's architecture,
# streams it into the directory k3s imports from before k3s exists, copies this
# checkout across, runs verify.sh, and brings the report back. Nothing is pushed
# to a registry and no credentials are needed — the image never leaves the two
# machines.
#
#   THE SERVER IS CHANGED PERMANENTLY. Use one you are willing to rebuild.
#
# DRY_RUN=1 prints every command instead of running it, which is how this is
# checked on a machine with no server and no Docker.
