# The crosscheck: every claim this product makes, against a real cluster.
#
# Everything in test/smoke checks Skifity against fakes, golden files and an
# in-process SSH server, because the machine it was built on could not start a
# cluster. This is the other half. It installs Skifity on a real server and then
# works through the checklist a self-hosted platform is actually judged on, in
# six phases:
#
#   1  Git to build to deploy, live build logs, a domain, a variable change,
#      a rollback, and a deploy that drops no requests.
#   2  A volume that survives a restart, a managed database, a backup that
#      restores, and an export you could leave with.
#   3  One team cannot see another's, one namespace cannot reach another's,
#      a quota is a real ceiling, and a member is not an admin.
#   4  The panel goes away and the apps keep serving. A node goes away and
#      Kubernetes puts the work somewhere else.
#   5  Logs, metrics, an upgrade with an app running through it, and a
#      notification that actually arrives when something fails.
#
# Phase 6 is a person: give somebody the documentation and nothing else, and see
# whether they get an app running. No script can do that one.
#
#   THIS INSTALLS k3s AND CHANGES THE MACHINE IT RUNS ON.
#
# Run it on a server you are willing to rebuild — a fresh VPS, not something you
# care about. It never runs itself: it asks first unless SKIFITY_ASSUME_YES=1.
#
#   sudo bash test/cluster/verify.sh
#
# What it needs: Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian 12+, 2 GB of memory, a public IP, and
# either a built image or SKIFITY_IMAGE pointing at one. With no domain it uses
# nip.io, so there is nothing to configure in DNS.
#
# It writes a report to /var/log/skifity-verify.log and prints the same at the
# end. When something fails it says which check, what it expected, and what to
# look at — the point is a report somebody can act on, not a green tick.
